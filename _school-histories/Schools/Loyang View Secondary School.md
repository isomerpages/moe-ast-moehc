#### **School History**
In 2018, Loyang View Secondary School (LVSS) was established as a result of the merger of Loyang Secondary School and Greenview Secondary School. With verve and optimism for a strong new school, the school leaders inspired and galvanised staff to collectively conceptualise a dream school where students are happy and motivated, and where teachers nurture them to be future-ready youths with good character. 

In 2018, LVSS was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in design and engineering, and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in sports and outdoor education. The ALP exposes students to design-based activities targeted at developing values, attitudes and skill sets related to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. This two-tiered programme aims to ignite students’ passion in STEM subjects by involving them in projects, enrichment activities and overseas exchange, and using the design thinking framework to solve problems, incorporating scientific knowledge and skills. 

Anchored by the belief that sports and outdoor activities offer rich learning experiences that complement character building and inspire passion for learning, the LLP aims to inculcate in students a love for sports and an appreciation for lifelong learning. This is achieved by providing students with skills for personal development in competitive and recreational sports, as well as through local and global outdoor activities and challenges.

LVSS celebrated its founding year with a series of events and projects, such as the inaugural LVSS musical entitled _LoVE_ (Loyang View Extravaganza), Grow My Character programme and enhancement of school environment.

In 2019, LVSS achieved the Lee Hsien Loong Award for the Normal Course in recognition of its structures, processes and programmes in embracing all learners.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/loyangviewsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is a unique symbol of the identity of the students and staff of LVSS. It comprises three core elements:
* three figures in an embrace – school, parents and students working hand in hand to achieve the school vision;
*  pixelated sun rays in the background – preparing students for the skill force in the digital age; and
*  a tree made up of the three figures and the sunrays – continuous growth of skills and knowledge.
The colours white and blue symbolise, respectively, purity as well as trust and responsibility.

Verse 1<br>
Marching to the beat of our nation’s drum,<br>
We strive towards our calling.<br>
To be a school that upholds<br>
Our nation’s pride and glory.

Chorus:<br>
Loyang View, a happy school we are.<br>
Where every life is touched, and every moment treasured.<br>
It’s a name we honour in word and deed.<br>
We dare to face each challenge,<br>
Learning to serve and lead.

Verse 2<br>
Friends of all races we embrace,<br>
Our hearts beating as one.<br>
Steadfast in character,<br>
With minds that are enlightened.

Chorus:<br>
Loyang View, a caring school we are.<br>
Where every life is touched, and every moment treasured.<br>
It’s a name we honour in word and deed.<br>
We dare to face each challenge,<br>
Learning to serve and lead.<br>
Within us lies the power<br>
To make our dreams come true.
