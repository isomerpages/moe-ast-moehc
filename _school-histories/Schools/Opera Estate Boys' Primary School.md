#### **School History**
Established in 1959, Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School was located at Fidelio Street. The school song was written by its first Principal, Mr B.R. Sethi.  
  
In 1969, the school hosted a funfair to raise funds for the development of their school projects. The funfair was opened by then Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Culture, Mr Sha’ari Tadin.&nbsp;  
  
In 1985, the school merged with neighbouring Opera Estate Girls’ Primary School to form Opera Estate Primary School. The new school included blue as one of its school colours to represent the school colour of Opera Estate Boys’ School.
