#### **School History**
Established in 1981, Mayflower Secondary School (MFSS) is a government co-educational school located on Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3. The school was officially opened in 1983 and celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2001.

From 2001 to 2005, MFSS operated from two campuses: the original school site, and the former Bowen Secondary School. In 2005, the new school building at 2 Ang Mo Kio Street 21 was completed. In 2011, Mayflower Secondary School celebrated its 30th anniversary.

In 2013, MFSS gained niche status in modern and ethnic dance. In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Developing a Zest for Life through the Aesthetics’, which aims to promote appreciation for the arts. In 2015, MFSS was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in effective communication, where students are developed as confident communicators through a progressive three-year tiered programme. In 2016, the school celebrated its 35th anniversary.

In 2018, MFSS established a satellite partnership with Pathlight School. In the same year, MFSS was accorded the Enhancement of Applied Learning Programme (Languages). The enhanced programme nurtures students with strengths in languages, and grooms a pipeline of mother tongue language talents and cultural transmitters for industries such as education and media.

#### **School Motto**
Mighty in Thought and Deed

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/mayflowersec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is composed of the letters, ‘M’ and ‘F’, encircled by the school name. ‘MF’, the initials of the school, is depicted as a stalk of flower. The ‘M’ is styled as a flower’s head, while the ‘F’ is designed as a stem with a blade of leaf on either side. This stalk of flower conveys the message, ‘Every Mayflowerian will bloom’.

While the design accentuates the development of the individual, it also emphasises the pursuit of knowledge. The latter is represented by the torch of wisdom that is supported by an open book. The stylised ‘M’ in red can be viewed as the torch of wisdom, while the two blades of leaves are likened to an open book. The leaves in green are synonymous with the quest for knowledge, just as green leaves seek nutrients for growth.

The letter ‘M’ is also linked to the concept of might, derived from the school motto, ‘Mighty in Thought and Deed’. The simple and bold lettering of ‘Mayflower Secondary School’, which is arranged in a circle, extols the attribute of might as the school unites in its efforts to be strong and righteous in thought and action.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Mayflower our dearest school<br>
Together aspire together we strive;<br>
From thee we derive<br>
The knowledge and the dignity<br>
To thee we give our love and loyalty.

Mayflower, Mayflower,<br>
To fame and glory, to fame and glory;<br>
Mayflower, Mayflower,<br>
We serve and honour our school and country.

Be mighty in thought and deed<br>
Be modest to all men no matter what creed;<br>
Onward we'll march<br>
with kindred and spirit aglow<br>
And that is our motto for a better tomorrow.
