#### **School Song**
We the mates of JDS<br>
Always filled with life and zest<br>
Both in lessons sports galore<br>
We must work for better score<br>
Be the going good or bad<br>
We must fight and never flag.

Strong and sturdy mates we are<br>
Living all in harmony<br>
Happy Happy as can be<br>
Proud to fly our colours three<br>
May our emblem always fly<br>
Never ever fade or die.

Let us all in one voice say<br>
May our school rise high one day<br>
Onward Onward to success<br>
Let this our motto e’er be blest.
