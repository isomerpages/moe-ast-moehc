#### **School History**
Established in 1955, Delta East Primary School was originally known as Delta Primary School. When Delta West Primary School was established in 1961, Delta Primary School changed its name to Delta East Primary School.

In 1985, Delta East Primary School merged with Delta West Primary School and Havelock Primary School to form Delta Primary School. Delta Primary School used the former campuses of Delta East Primary School and Delta West Primary School. In 1990, Delta Primary School closed and since then, the former site of the school has remained vacant.
