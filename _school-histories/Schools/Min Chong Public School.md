<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>The history of Min Chong Public School dates back to the pre-World War
Two period. It was established during the pre-war times as Bo Wen School
and Pei Nan School at Mata Ikan, a village in Changi. It aimed to provide
education for children living in the village.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of WWII, the school’s provision of education was disrupted.
However, after the war, the committee of Pei Nan School decided to provide
education for children whose studies had been halted. The school was thus
reopened and renamed Min Chong School. The school was housed in a three-storey
rented bungalow and its 150 students were taught by ten staff.</p>
<p>Min Chong Public School was the first Chinese-medium school to offer an
English Language stream in the post-war era to cater to the needs of Malay
village children.</p>
<p>However, with the establishment of new English-medium schools in the vicinity
of the village, demand for Min Chong Public School’s English Language stream
dwindled. The school eventually stopped its English Language stream and
reverted to operating as a Chinese-medium school.</p>
<p>The school hence relocated to 823 Somapah Road, off Upper Changi Road.</p>
<p>Over time, enrolment numbers fell largely due to a growing demand for
English-medium education in the 1970s and more residents’ relocation out
of the area upon the construction of Changi Airport.</p>
<p>Due to low enrolment rates, the school closed in 1981.</p>
