<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Outram Road School was established on 26 February 1906. In 1939, the school
was renamed Outram School, and was a feeder primary school to Raffles Institution
until the fall of Singapore in February 1942.</p>
<p>On 1 January 1954, Outram School became a secondary school with a four-year
Commerce course leading to the School Certificate of Commercial Education
of the London Chamber of Commerce. In 1958, Outram School started admitting
girls and became a co-educational school. In 1961, the school was renamed
Outram Secondary School. In 1968, the school relocated to its current premises
at York Hill, off Chin Swee Road. In 1969, the school began focusing on
commercial education for its upper secondary levels.</p>
<p>The school’s swimming pool complex was completed and officially opened
in 1977. In 1982, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary and commemorated
it with the book,&nbsp;<em>75 Years Today: Outram Secondary School</em>.
Outram Secondary School moved to a temporary site at 10 Winstedt Road in
June 1994 to make way for the redevelopment of new premises at York Hill.</p>
<p>In 1996, Outram Secondary School celebrated its 90th anniversary. In June
1998, the school returned to its present premises. In 2006, the school
celebrated its centennial anniversary and launched the commemorative&nbsp;book,&nbsp;<em>Labor&nbsp;Conquers All – 100 years of Outram Secondary School</em>.
In 2016, Outram Secondary School celebrated its 110th anniversary.</p>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme focuses on business and enterprise,
while its Learning for Life Programme is in sports and outdoor education.
The latter aims to imbue the value of ‘sports for life’ in its students.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Labor Omnia Vincit
<br>Latin for ‘Labour Conquers All’</p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>

</div>
<p>The book symbolises academic learning – to instruct, impart knowledge,
teach and learn.&nbsp;The lion represents the school’s association with
Singapore, the Lion City.&nbsp;The castle signifies a tower of learning;
a place where all can study; a self-contained unit; and a place where unity,
cooperation and teamwork produce a community (tower) of strength. The lion
and the castle together symbolise Outram as one of the centres of learning
in Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong>School Song</strong></h4>

<p>We will go marching on together
<br>True to our Alma Mater,
<br>We will strive and march to victory,
<br>Loyal Outramians are we.</p>
<p>CHORUS:
<br>Onward, friends, be true, sincere,
<br>Work and foes we must not fear,
<br>Never falter, never fall,
<br>Labour conquers all.
<br>We will raise our standards high,
<br>And with our voices cry;
<br>Brave and true hearts we will always be,
<br>Loyal Outramians are we.</p>
