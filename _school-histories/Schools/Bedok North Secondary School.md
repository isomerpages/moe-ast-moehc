#### **School History**
Bedok North Secondary School (BNSS) was established in January 1981 at Bedok North Avenue 3. As there were several primary schools in the Bedok Reservoir area, there was a rising demand for a secondary school to serve the needs of the residents there. In 2000, BNSS moved to a new campus on Jalan Damai, which was equipped with bigger and better facilities.

In 2001, the school’s Drama Club clinched the silver award in the Singapore Youth Festival during its debut. This provided the impetus for Bedok North’s performing arts groups to blossom in the subsequent years. Building on these successes, BNSS developed its niche in the performing arts. It provided a platform for Bedok Northians to develop their talent in the performing arts.

In 2011, BNSS launched its Heritage Gallery, which dedicated a segment to educating students and the public on the history of Kampung Melayu. The Eunos Heritage Trail was established in the same year as part of the Heritage Education Programme. Students served as guides for the heritage trail, attended by residents and students from neighbouring primary schools.

BNSS also worked with the larger community extensively: Student volunteers provided companionship to beneficiaries of Thye Hwa Kwan Senior Activity Centre and St Andrew’s Community Hospital. Bedok North students also advocated for the environment, spreading messages on energy and water conservation through working with kindergartens.

In 2017, BNSS celebrated its 36th anniversary. In 2018, it merged with Damai Secondary School and the merged school has since operated under the name of Damai Secondary School.

#### **School Motto**
Learn and Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bedoknorthsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is in beige and maroon colours. The five digits of the hand symbolise the five desired outcomes for the students: strive for excellence, encourage experimentation, rejoice in doing good, value diversity and embrace life-long learning. Starting from a common base, each student endeavours towards different heights of achievement. Each digit leads to a circle representing a goal that the student sets for himself/herself.

In addition, the five digits and the hand symbolise the six school values: resilience, respect, responsibility, integrity, care, and working together in harmony. The logo also resembles books on a shelf, hence symbolising learning and knowledge.
