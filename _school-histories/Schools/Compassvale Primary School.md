#### **School History**
Compassvale Primary School was established on 4 January 1999 at a holding site in Sengkang Primary School.

In January 2000, Compassvale Primary School shifted temporarily to a second holding site in Rivervale Primary School as the school building was still under construction. The school moved into its present premises on 13 November 2000 and was officially opened on 21 October 2001.

The school hosted the Ministry of Education Excel Fest in 2006. It achieved the Centre of Excellence for English in the following year and celebrated its 10th year of operations in 2008. The school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme for Aesthetics, and the Applied Learning Programme in Robotics.

The upgrading of the school building was completed in December 2012. Since January 2013, Compassvale Primary School has been single session.

In 2019, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary as it continues serving the Sengkang community.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/compassvalepri1.png">

The emblem reflects the school’s commitment to the total development of the child through quality education centred on values and compassion, instilling the desire for lifelong learning and guiding students as they strive towards a successful future for themselves and Singapore.

The school colours are blue and white. The colour blue signifies both a healthy lifestyle as well as the sea of knowledge. It also provides a link to Sengkang’s historical ties to the sea as a harbour. The colour white symbolises purity of values, thought and actions. The interplay of colours represent the deliberate balance to achieve virtuous use of knowledge.

The three concentric rings, that give the emblem its shape, symbolise the holistic growth of the individual at the centre, with an encompassing family followed by society. The geometry of the emblem forms the image of a compass, a tool for navigation, signifying the school’s mission to guide students as they journey through life by being grounded on values. The needle of the compass has a gold tip which symbolises wisdom, excellence and success. It points to the North-East, the region of Singapore in which the school is located.
