#### **School History**
Peck Seah Primary School was established in 1967. The seven-storey school building was located at Peck Seah Street. Peck Seah Primary School offered both English and Tamil medium education. The school was officially opened on 29 June 1967 by then Minister for Education Mr Ong Pang Boon and then Member of Parliament for Anson Mr P. Govindaswamy.

In 1984, Peck Seah Primary School closed. Most of its students moved to Yeung Ching School (currently Yangzheng Primary School) in 1986. The site of Peck Seah Primary School was initially planned to be used for the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station but this plan was not carried out. From 1985 to 2013, the school building was occupied by the Public Works Departmentâ€™s offices. The building was later demolished in 2013. Since then, commercial and residential buildings have occupied the site.

Principals:<br>
