#### **School History**
Chestnut Drive Secondary School, Singapore’s 105th government school, was established in 1968 as a Chinese integrated school with 787 students. It was officially opened on 12 June 1969. Located in Upper Bukit Timah, CDSS was built to serve a vast area, including Woodlands, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong and even Yishun.

In the early years, the school conducted classes for both English and Chinese streams. The Chinese stream was gradually phased out and integrated into a single English stream in 1987. In 1988, the school converted from double session to single session.

In 2002, the school moved into its new campus, which was officially opened on 9 July 2005. At the same time, a new uniform was also launched in 2004.

In 2014, the school was recognised as a Microsoft Mentor School for its innovative best practices in the use of technology for teaching and learning. The school was also awarded the Singapore Book of Records three years in a row for the following projects: ‘Hand to Hand’, the most number of gloves on a display board (2011);  ‘Project Run’, the most number of well-wishing cards (2010); and ‘Project Orange Nose’,  the most number of people wearing orange noses (2009).

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme on sustainability. It was based on science, technology, engineering and mathematics as well as humanities applications in the real world. 

The school celebrated its 45th anniversary in 2011 with an original musical. In 2016, the school merged with Fajar Secondary School and continued operating under the name of Fajar Secondary School. Chestnut Drive Secondary School’s Chinese name, 励进中学, has since been adopted as the Chinese name of Fajar Secondary School.
