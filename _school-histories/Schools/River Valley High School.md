In 1979, River Valley High School was selected to be a Special Assistance Plan school. It moved to West Coast Road in 1986. River Valley High School became single-session in 1993 and gained autonomous status in the following year.

In 2007, the school started offering the Bicultural Studies Programme and established the Centre of Excellence for Science and Technology (West Zone).

#### **School Song**
海云缦缦 碧波荡荡<br>
赤道绿洲 有我学堂<br>
春风化雨 桃李成行<br>
立德立功 化愚化顽

愿我学子 勿忘勿忘<br>
他日我校 光芒万丈<br>
愿我学子 勿忘勿忘<br>
他日我校 光芒万丈

与日月争光兮<br>
与天地共久长
