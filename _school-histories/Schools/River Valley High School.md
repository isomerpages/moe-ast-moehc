In 1979, River Valley High School was selected to be a Special Assistance Plan school. It moved to West Coast Road in 1986. River Valley High School became single-session in 1993 and gained autonomous status in the following year.

海云缦缦 碧波荡荡<br>
赤道绿洲 有我学堂<br>
春风化雨 桃李成行<br>
立德立功 化愚化顽

愿我学子 勿忘勿忘<br>
他日我校 光芒万丈<br>
愿我学子 勿忘勿忘<br>
他日我校 光芒万丈

与日月争光兮<br>
与天地共久长
