#### **School History**
Established in 1994, Pioneer Secondary School was a government co-educational school. Initially sharing premises with Hong Kah Secondary School in Jurong West Street 42, the school relocated to new premises at Jurong West Street 81 in November that year. The school was officially opened in 1997.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Creating Possibilities with Materials Science through a User-centred Approach’. It aimed to develop in students a scientific and design-thinking mindset, and equip them with foundational research and experimental skills through exploratory hands-on activities.

In the following year, the school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘The Pioneer-STAR! (Shine Through the Arts) Programme’, provided students with the opportunities to shine in the arts through the progressive development of their artistic skills in different art forms. This was also achieved with an aesthetic curriculum that would develop the students’ values, socio-emotional competencies and life skills, as well as encourage community service.

In 2017, Pioneer&nbsp;Secondary merged with Boon Lay&nbsp;Secondary School, taking on the latter’s name and moving to its premises.

\- Mrs Yeo Chin Nam (1994)<br>

#### **School Motto**
To Persevere, Seek and Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/pioneersec1.jpg">

The three lines on the torch symbolise family, community and the nation. Upholding these institutions are the individual/student and the school, represented by the two vertical posts. The right, stronger post stands for the school, which helps students to grow, developing their potential and equipping them with skills to serve the community and nation.  
  
The flame of the torch burns bright and strong, depicting the desire to shine for the school and the nation. In order to do that, one needs to burn with enthusiasm and be charged with the pioneering spirit so that life can be lived to the fullest through service to others.  
  
The open book stands for wisdom and knowledge, and a love for learning that all students should aspire towards.
