#### **School History**
Established in 1963, Norfolk Primary School was located along Norfolk Road.  
  
In 1984, Norfolk Primary School closed. The remaining students in Norfolk Primary School were then transferred to neighbouring Cambridge Primary School. Cambridge Primary School subsequently used the campus of Norfolk Primary School. In 1998, Cambridge Primary School closed and its remaining students joined May Primary School, which is currently known as Farrer Park Primary School.&nbsp; &nbsp;  
  
From 1998 to the present, the school buildings of Norfolk Primary School and Cambridge Primary School have been used as dormitories for foreign students.
