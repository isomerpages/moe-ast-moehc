<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 1963, Norfolk Primary School was located along Norfolk
Road.</p>
<p>In 1984, Norfolk Primary School closed. The remaining students in Norfolk
Primary School were then transferred to neighbouring Cambridge Primary
School. Cambridge Primary School subsequently used the campus of Norfolk
Primary School. In 1998, Cambridge Primary School closed and its remaining
students joined May Primary School, which is currently known as Farrer
Park Primary School.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>From 1998 to the present, the school buildings of Norfolk Primary School
and Cambridge Primary School have been used as dormitories for foreign
students.</p>
