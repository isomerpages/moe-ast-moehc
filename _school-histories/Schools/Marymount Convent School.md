#### **School History**
Marymount Convent School belongs to the Good Shepherd Order. The Sisters of the Good Shepherd, an international order of more than 6,000 religious women, was founded by St Mary Euphrasia Pelletier in France in 1835.

St Mary Euphrasia believed in God’s merciful love for people, especially those who suffered from the consequences of sin. She spent her whole life zealously working for the Salvation of Souls, helping to reconcile those who were lost with the mercy and forgiveness of God. After her example and sharing her vision, the Sisters’ Mission was directed towards the rejected, those wounded because of sin and its consequences, individuals and families. The philosophy underpinning their work is the belief in the infinite value of the human person.

Today, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd serve in over&nbsp;60&nbsp;countries. In Singapore, they serve society in a variety of ways,&nbsp;including&nbsp;education.&nbsp;

In 1939, the first Good Shepherd missionaries, led by Mother Ligouri Burke, arrived in Singapore. After the Japanese Occupation in 1945, they started a primary school for girls in a rented house&nbsp;on&nbsp;Kampong Java Road. Responding to the need for a bigger site to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;the increase in enrolment, the lease to the land at Thomson Road was signed in 1947. Fired by her desire to provide an all-round quality education for girls, Mother Ligouri worked relentlessly with Dr Ee Peng Liang to build Marymount Convent School. It was officially opened as a full school in 1958 with Sister Maurice O’Neil as the first principal.

In December&nbsp;1995, the secondary section was closed, and the school continued exclusively as a primary school. The school then embarked on a rebuilding programme. In December 1996, it moved to holding premises&nbsp;and returned&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new building at its original, tranquil site at 20 Marymount Road on 28 June 1999. The premises were officially opened on 24 April 2001.

The school was upgraded again under&nbsp;the&nbsp;PERI initiative from 2015 to 2016.&nbsp;Temporarily located at a holding site,&nbsp;Marymount Convent&nbsp;returned to its upgraded campus at its current premises in December 2016.&nbsp;The school&nbsp;celebrated its 60th&nbsp;anniversary in 2017.
