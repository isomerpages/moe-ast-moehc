#### **School History**
Marymount Convent School belongs to the Good Shepherd Order. The Sisters of the Good Shepherd, an international order of more than 6,000 religious women, was founded by St Mary Euphrasia Pelletier in France in 1835.

St Mary Euphrasia believed in God’s merciful love for people, especially those who suffered from the consequences of sin. She spent her whole life zealously working for the Salvation of Souls, helping to reconcile those who were lost with the mercy and forgiveness of God. After her example and sharing her vision, the Sisters’ Mission was directed towards the rejected, those wounded because of sin and its consequences, individuals and families. The philosophy underpinning their work is the belief in the infinite value of the human person.

Today, the Sisters of the Good Shepherd serve in over 60 countries. In Singapore, they serve society in a variety of ways, including education. 

In 1939, the first Good Shepherd missionaries, led by Mother Ligouri Burke, arrived in Singapore. After the Japanese Occupation in 1945, they started a primary school for girls in a rented house on Kampong Java Road. Responding to the need for a bigger site to accommodate the increase in enrolment, the lease to the land at Thomson Road was signed in 1947. Fired by her desire to provide an all-round quality education for girls, Mother Ligouri worked relentlessly with Dr Ee Peng Liang to build Marymount Convent School. It was officially opened as a full school in 1958 with Sister Maurice O’Neil as the first principal.

In December 1995, the secondary section was closed, and the school continued exclusively as a primary school. The school then embarked on a rebuilding programme. In December 1996, it moved to holding premises and returned to a new building at its original, tranquil site at 20 Marymount Road on 28 June 1999. The premises were officially opened on 24 April 2001.

The school was upgraded again under the PERI initiative from 2015 to 2016. Temporarily located at a holding site, Marymount Convent returned to its upgraded campus at its current premises in December 2016. The school celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017.

Guided by God’s eternal light<br>
We're one in heart and one in mind<br>
Loyal to school and true to LIGHT<br>
For we are the daughters of Marymount
  
_Chorus_
O Marymount, our school our pride<br>
Ever to thee we will abide<br>
Sure as strong, we'll win over wrong<br>
The light of God our guide<br>
For we are the daughters of Marymount (x2)
