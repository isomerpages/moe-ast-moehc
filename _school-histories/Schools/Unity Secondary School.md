#### **School History**
Unity Secondary School was established in January 2000 as a government co-educational school. It was officially opened on 15 November 2001.&nbsp;  
  
In 2004, Unity Secondary presented its first musical, To Oz in Unity, as part of its fifth anniversary celebrations. In 2009, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary with a funfair to raise funds for students with financial needs. In 2010, the school hosted one of the legs of the torch relay of the inaugural Youth Olympic Games.&nbsp;  
  
Unity Secondary gained niche status in basketball in 2009 – its basketball teams have been achieving excellent results at both the zonal and national levels. The six uniformed groups have also shown excellent performance to secure the prestigious Sustained Achievement Awards, and the school attained niche status for uniformed groups in 2012.&nbsp;  
In 2014, as part of its 15th anniversary celebrations, the school set two records in the Singapore Book of Records. The first was for the most number of people bouncing a basketball simultaneously, known as ‘The Unity Bounce’. The second was for creating the largest thumbprint art called ‘Thumbs-up in Unity’. The artwork was showcased as part of the Unity Spirit Art Exhibition during the school’s anniversary musical.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
In 2015, Unity Secondary was accorded the Lifelong Learning Programme in sports and outdoor education known as ‘Leading through Outdoors and Sporting Adventures’. It offers developmental opportunities for all students as they attend key outdoor and sport modules to learn how to lead themselves, others and teams.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  
In the same year, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in applied science called ‘Inspire through Agro-Bio Science and Technology’. The programme aims to develop scientific innovation and enterprise skill in students by creating opportunities through hands-on exploration projects such as working on research relating to hydroponics, the reduction of carbon footprint as well as food waste.&nbsp;  
  
In 2018, the Applied Learning Programme was renamed as ‘Biotechnology in Food Sustainability’ to place greater emphasis on enriching our students with skills of Biotechnology to relate to real world problems of food sustainability especially in the context of Singapore.&nbsp; Students learn basic Microscopy, Microbiology, Plant Tissue Culture, Food Waste Composting and Hydroponics.  
  
In 2019, Unity Secondary celebrated its 20th anniversary.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/unitysec1.png">

The sharp piercing eyes of the eagle symbolise vision. With vision, the school prepares its students for the future by equipping them with the relevant knowledge and skills and by instilling in them sound moral values, so that they can face the future with confidence and fortitude.

The outstretched wings suggesting full flight symbolise ceaseless striving for excellence. In Unity Secondary School, every student works relentlessly to achieve excellence in whatever he or she does.

The majestic royal palm, always upright – just like the letter ‘I’ – symbolises integrity, which forms the bedrock of all pursuits and endeavours in the school.

The colour red symbolises universal brotherhood, which unites all in the school, despite diverse racial and religious backgrounds, into one community with a common destiny. The colour green symbolises harmony, which the school seeks to develop within each student and in the school as a whole. It is the foundation on which the school seeks to build its progress and achievements. The colour white symbolises purity of purpose and intentions, which marks all of the school’s endeavours.
