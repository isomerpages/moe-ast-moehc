#### **School Motto**
On To The Best

#### **School Crest**

The colours of the school are **red** and **white**, identifying it with the Singapore flag.

The **nub** of the crest, which is 善 (shan), is derived from the name of the school, 崇善 (Chong Shan). “Shan” meaning goodness, kindness or perfection. It is portrayed as a pot of young and upright plant, which signifies the growth of education.

The **inner upward curve** represents the glow of sunshine leading the pupils towards a bright future.

#### **School Song**
Onward march pupils of Chong Shan<br>
Battles to win under the sun<br>
To be the best is our aim<br>
With confidence march on
 
On to the best, march on<br>
On to the best, march on<br>
On to the best, we’ll march on
 
Singapore’s pride we’ll one day be<br>
Proudly uphold our glory, skills and knowledge<br>
We’ll pursue with confidence<br>
March on<br>
We’ll march on.
