#### **School Crest**

The colours of the school are&nbsp;**red**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**white**, identifying it with the Singapore flag.

The&nbsp;**nub**&nbsp;of the crest, which is 善 (shan), is derived from the name of the school, 崇善 (Chong Shan). “Shan” meaning goodness, kindness or perfection. It is portrayed as a pot of young and upright plant, which signifies the growth of education.

The&nbsp;**inner upward curve**&nbsp;represents the glow of sunshine leading the pupils towards a bright future.
