The school crest depicts birds ready to soar into the sky from a sturdy branch. The birds signify Woodgrovers as dynamic learners, grounded on sound values and daring to fly up high to achieve their goals and overcome future challenges. The leaves signify life and growth in a harmonious, safe and supportive environment as the school prepares the learners well in the pursuit of their dreams.

The colour yellow symbolises positive attitudes and a strong commitment to excel in one’s responsibilities. The colour orange mirrors a burning passion, the vigour and hunger for progress as well as a determination to achieve one’s goals. The colour green denotes virtue and an appreciation for aesthetics, while white projects purity, integrity as well as a professional image and standard.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

There’s a ray of hope in our hearts<br>
For in Woodgrove, we will learn and grow<br>
We will shape the future from this start<br>
Loving our country with all of our hearts

Chorus<br>
Woodgrove Secondary where we grow in grace and dignity.<br>
This is where we will live in hope and joy, love and harmony

Realise our dreams, no matter how hard it seems to be<br>
Determined to be the best!  

(Repeat Chorus)
