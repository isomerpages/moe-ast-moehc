#### **School History**
St Andrew’s Junior College (SAJC) started as a vision of faith when the Anglican Church, in line with national educational developments in the 1970s, took up the challenge of building a junior college. The building project was subsequently joined by the Lutheran and Presbyterian Churches. Construction began on 6 September 1976 after Right Reverend Chiu Ban It, Bishop of Singapore, gave his blessings and the foundation stone was laid by Tan Sri Runme Shaw on 10 December that year.

Sited on six hectares of land on Malan Road, the original college premises had a built-in area of over 10,200 square metres. SAJC admitted its first batch of 600 students to the arts and science faculties on 3 January 1978. The founding principal of SAJC was Reverend John Tan Teng Wai. The college was officially declared open by Tan Sri Runme Shaw on 30 June 1979. The college’s facilities were upgraded in 1993, and the dedication of the new facilities by Mr Shaw Vee Meng took place on 18 February 1995.

Plans to relocate the college back to Woodsville began in the late 1990s, and the building plans for the new premises started in 2000. The new college moved to Potong Pasir on 15 December 2005. Sitting on 5.5 hectares of land, it is part of St Andrew’s Village. The building was officially declared open by then Minister for Education Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam on 26 August 2006.

Under the leadership of its various principals, SAJC grew from strength to strength with significant achievements in teaching and learning, sports, the performing arts and community service. In 2018, SAJC commemorated its 40th anniversary with a series of celebratory milestones. Themed ‘40 Years of Making Lives and Waking Hearts’, SAJC celebrated God’s goodness and guidance in making the lives and waking the hearts of students who have passed through its gates since its founding.

SAJC’s current enrolment stands at about 1450 students with a staff strength of about 170.

#### **School Motto**
Up and On

The school motto is taken from the title of John Oxenham’s poem, ‘Up and On’, which urges the college and students to persevere and aspire to God-centred and high endeavours. The motto needs to be interpreted and appreciated in the context of the lyrics of the school song.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/standrewjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest is in the shape of a shield and bears the St Andrew’s cross in white on a background of navy blue, white and blue – the St Andrew’s colours. The two keys symbolise the keys to a life of worth on earth and eternal life in heaven. The tiger’s head represents strength and power as well as the fact that St Andrew’s School (from which the college originated) was founded in the Straits Settlements.

Lives are in the making here,<br>
Hearts are in the waking here,<br>
Mighty undertaking here,<br>
Up and On! Up and On!

We are arming for the fight,<br>
Pressing on with all our might,<br>
Pluming wings for higher flight,<br>
Up and On!

Up Saints! Truest fame<br>
Lies in high endeavour;<br>
Play the game! keep the flame<br>
Burning brightly ever!

Fair before us lies the way,<br>
Time for work and time for play;<br>
Fill the measure while we may,<br>
Up and On! Up and On!

Life and time will not delay,<br>
Time is running fast away,<br>
Life is now today; today;<br>
Up and On!

Up Saints! Truest fame<br>
Lies in high endeavour;<br>
Play the game! keep the flame<br>
Burning brightly ever!

Foes in plenty we shall meet,<br>
Hearts courageous scorn defeat;<br>
So we press with eager feet,<br>
Up and On! Up and On!

Ever onward to the fight,
Ever upward to the Light,
Ever true to GOD and RIGHT,
Up and On!

Up Saints! Truest fame
Lies in high endeavour;
Play the game! keep the flame
Burning brightly ever!
