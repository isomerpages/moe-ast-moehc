#### **School History**
As a result of Singapore’s changing demographic profile, Anderson Junior College (AJC) and Serangoon Junior College (SRJC) were merged to form Anderson Serangoon Junior College (ASRJC) in 2019. The two strong colleges had developed and groomed thousands of students over a span of 65 years.  

Preparations for the merger had begun as early as 2017. A joint open house and orientation at the start of 2018 set the stage for a year of collaborations and consultations for other aspects of the merged college, including the uniform, crest and programmes. In January 2019, the college officially began operations at the former AJC campus in Ang Mo Kio. Due to campus rejuvenation works, the college will temporarily operate at the former SRJC campus along Upper Serangoon Road from 2022 to 2025.

Under the leadership of its founding principal, Mr Manogaran Suppiah, the college embarked on its maiden envisioning exercise, which culminated in the launch of the college vision, mission, values and motto on its first College Day on 27 July 2019.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/andersonsrjc1.png" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The college crest is inspired by the ‘flame’ element that is in both Anderson and Serangoon Junior Colleges’ crests as well as a flower bud that is ready to bloom.

The flame design is formed by the college initials ‘ASR’. The continued use of the flame element represents the merged colleges’ history and heritage. The flame also symbolises truth, light and hope, which captures the college’s intent to develop justice- and service-oriented students who are enlightened and in service of others. The flower bud symbolises youth and vitality, and represents the college as a place that nurtures leaders for the nation. Each petal of the flower embodies the college colours, signifying the way in which the college seeks to nurture students who are adventurous in thinking and boundless in imagination, while remaining grounded and empathetic citizens of the nation.
