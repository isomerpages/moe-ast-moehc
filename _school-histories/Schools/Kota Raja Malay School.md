#### **School History**
Established in 1933, Kota Raja Malay School was located at Syed Alwi Street Road, in the building that had previously housed Victoria School.  
  
Kota Raja Malay School started off as an all-boys school and became a co-ed school in 1979.  
  
In 1982, due to declining enrolment, Kota Raja Malay School closed. The former school building of Kota Raja Malay School was slated to be used as MENDAKI (Council for the Development of Singapore Malay/Muslim Community)â€™s headquarters building. However, this did not happen and the site was redeveloped.
