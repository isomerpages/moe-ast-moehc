#### **School History**
Chung Cheng High School started as an all-boys school at 60 Kim Yan Road in 1939. The school was guided by the philosophy, ‘Excellence in Education for All’, and admitted students from all strata of society. When the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942, the school was forced to cease operations. After resuming in 1945 following the end of the war, it began to enrol female students.

The school achieved top honours in the first national examination in 1947. With rising enrolment, a 14-acre plot of land at Goodman Road was purchased for a new campus. This new campus became home to Chung Cheng High School (Main), while the original campus at Kim Yan Road housed Chung Cheng High School (Branch).

In 1979, Chung Cheng High School (Main) was selected as one of the nine Special Assistance Plan schools, offering both English and Chinese as first languages. This helped the school strengthen its emphasis on bilingualism and served as a catalyst to nurture bilingual and bicultural students.

In 1996, the school was granted autonomous status, which enabled the school to innovate and enhance its curriculum. In 2005, the school was selected as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Chinese to promote an appreciation and understanding of Chinese history and culture through the active sharing of resources and exchange of expertise among practitioners.

Between 2010 and 2012, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, which saw an expansion of the school facilities to support the school’s vibrant student population. In 2014, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary. The school’s entrance arch and administration building (Zhulin Building) were gazetted as national monuments at a ceremony officiated by Prime Minister Mr Lee Hsien Loong.&nbsp;  
  
In 2019, the school celebrated its 80th&nbsp;anniversary, Chung Cheng 80, with the theme “Honouring Our Heritage, Inspiring Our Future”. A brass replica of &nbsp;the&nbsp;中正人sculpture was installed to inspire new generations of Chung Cheng students. The original concrete sculpture installed in 1969 was donated to National Gallery Singapore for heritage conservation.&nbsp; &nbsp;

In 2023, the school embarked on an upgrading project for the Administration Building (Zhulin Building) and Grand Auditorium.

The three sides of the triangle represent the collaboration between the school’s management, teachers and pupils. These three work hand in hand to bring the school to greater heights. The colour red represents the school motto – “With Passion We Learn, With Perseverance We Strive” and “With Integrity We Live, With Commitment We Progress”. It inspires pupils to be upright, caring and loyal citizens. White symbolises purity and also signifies the imparting of knowledge. It serves to highlight the dual importance our school places on encouraging our pupils to achieve excellence in both studies and character building.
