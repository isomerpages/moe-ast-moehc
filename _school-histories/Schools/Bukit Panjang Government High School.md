#### **School History**
Established in 1960, Bukit Panjang Government High School started in a two-storey school campus on Jalan Teck Whye. The school served and provided education for the children of the community of manual workers, small traders, as well as pig, vegetable and poultry farmers living in Bukit Panjang and the surrounding areas of Bukit Gombak, Mandai and Woodlands.

Bukit Panjang Government High School was the first integrated government secondary school in Singapore. Two different language streams, Chinese and English, were run by a single administration with students sharing classrooms and teachers sharing a common room.

In 1994, Bukit Panjang Government High School became an autonomous school. The following year, the school relocated to its current location at Choa Chu Kang Avenue 4. The new campus provided a nurturing environment that supported holistic learning for the students. Subsequently, the school underwent PRIME upgrading from 2007 to 2008, which saw the addition of facilities such as an indoor sports hall to provide more quality learning for students.

Today, Bukit Panjang Government High School continues to provide students with a holistic and fulfilling education, and has consistently produced value-added academic results. It is recognised for its organisational excellence and student development beyond academia. The school also continues to excel in its niche areas such as the Elective Malay Language Programme and the Art Elective Programme. As a Centre of Excellence, Bukit Panjang Government High School leads in the professional development of mathematics teachers in the West Zone.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bukitpanjanggovernmenthigh1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The circle symbolises integration and perfection, while the red triangle stands for brotherhood and the common bond among all BPians. The three points of the triangle represent freedom, equality and benevolence, which are beacons in our lives. The green background represents the green countryside of our district, reminding us of our humble rural beginnings. The book, which features our motto, signifies BPians’ educational journey. The three symbols stand for different aspects of our educational programme: the atom (top left), for laying a strong foundation in cognitive and character development; the ship (top right), for imbuing a spirit of discovery and lifelong learning; and the hurdler (bottom), for building a robust body and mind ready to take on life’s challenges.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

吾校武中，英勇前进<br>
Forward, forward on to glory,

并肩携手，迈向光明<br>
Let’s march in wisdom hand in hand,

扬我校誉，相爱相亲<br>
To build our school’s and nation’s story,

建我新国，充满热情<br>
With pride in our multiracial land.

埋头苦干，不怕艰辛<br>
Come fear no hardship,

坚毅奋斗，竭尽忠精<br>
Live and toil in duty, strength and devotion.

任重道远，寸阴是竞<br>
Like the granite of our soil,

勤劳建国，坚固如金<br>
We will make a hardy nation.

武中武中，傲立山林<br>
Bukit Panjang, Bukit Panjang,

不分种族，合群同心<br>
How proudly our school stands amid the hills.

共同学习，一团欢欣<br>
Diligent in study and practice

遵我校训，笃学力行<br>
Is our motto and our will.
