#### **School History**
Seletar Institute (SI) was established in 1988 as Singapore’s second centralised institute at Upper Thomson Road. The institute used the campus of Upper Thomson Secondary School which had been closed. It began operations with 17 staff and 186 students in January 1989.  
  
With a fall in demand for three-year pre-university courses,  Seletar Institute witnessed a rapidly falling enrolment to 130 students in 1995. When Seletar Institute closed  in 1997, the former campus of the Institute was left vacant.
