#### **School History**
Yuying Secondary School was established as Yock Eng High School by the Hainanese community in 1910. Located on Prinsep Street, the Chinese-medium high school started with an enrolment of only 15 students. Over the years, as the enrolment grew, the School Management Board initiated a campaign to raise funds for new premises in 1939.&nbsp;

With great pride, the school moved to a new campus at 65 Tanjong Katong Road in 1941. However, the outbreak of the Second World War led to the Japanese armed forces occupying the school premises and education was disrupted.

After the war, Yock Eng reopened in 1946 with an enrolment of 600. The postwar years saw a period of rapid growth for the school. In 1956, the senior high section was established and Yock Eng High became a full school, catering to students from primary to senior high levels. With increasing recognition, the enrolment peaked at 2,400 students in 1958. With the shift towards English-medium education in the 1960s and ’70s, the school admitted its first batch of English-medium students in 1981. In 1983, the primary section was discontinued, and the final cohort of Chinese-medium students graduated in 1988.

On 9 December 1985, the school relocated to its current premises at 47 Hougang Avenue 1. Renamed as Yuying Secondary School, it was officially opened on 13 August 1987. The Yuying Alumni Association was established in 1994. The alumni’s contributions include financial support, assistance in providing expert knowledge as well as donations of artefacts for school use.

With support from the School Management Committee, Yuying organises biennial overseas cultural immersion trips for its students to Hainan province in China. The trips allow students to have a deeper understanding of the culture and values of their peers from another country and help to deepen their global perspectives.

In 2014, Yuying was among the first schools to launch the Applied Learning and Learning for Life programmes, which have since undergone refinements to strengthen the holistic development of students.

Today, Yuying is a government-aided school with strong unwavering support from the School Management Committee and the Yuying Alumni Association. It continues to inculcate in its students the values of integrity, respect, responsibility and resilience, which have been the hallmark of the school all these years.

#### **School Motto**
Together, Achieve Personal Excellence

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/yuyingsec1.jpg">

The school crest features the Chinese name of the school, 育英 – ‘育’ means to nurture, and ‘英’ refers to heroes or talents. Together, the name encapsulates the desire of the school to nurture its students and develop their talents so that they can contribute to society.

The eagle in flight in the middle of the crest symbolises the students soaring like eagles – strong, swift and powerful – always striving to achieve greater heights. The bold strokes forming the eagle is stylised like a double ‘Y’, for ‘Yuying’. It also signifies the value of resilience and decisiveness inculcated in the students.

A reminder to stay rooted, the white and red colours bear similar symbolic meaning to the national flag. White represents purity, and the red eagle symbolises universal brotherhood and teamwork. These values also invoke the school motto, ‘Together, Achieve Personal Excellence’, which emphasises the importance of teamwork and unity within the school. The focus on excellence spurs students of Yuying Secondary School to realise their potential and face every challenge with courage and determination.
