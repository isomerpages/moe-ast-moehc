#### **School History**
Established in 1926, Telok Kurau Primary School was originally known as Telok Kurau English School. The school was housed in a two-storey wooden structure set amidst a vast coconut plantation on Telok Kurau Road. It sought to cater to a growing population eager to be educated in English. Singapore’s founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew and former Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Datuk Hussein Onn were students of the school.

The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation and reopened in 1945 with the end of the Second World War. In 1958, to accommodate an increasing population, a new wing was added to the school premises. To further cater to the growth of the school-going population in the vicinity, two other schools bearing the name ‘Telok Kurau’ were built: Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School in 1960 and Telok Kurau West School in 1962. Telok Kurau English School then became known as Telok Kurau East School in 1962.

A four-storey building at 408 Joo Chiat Place was built in 1967 to replace the old wooden building, and the new building was officially declared open in 1968. For the first time, girls were admitted to the school, and by 1969, the school population had grown to 2,500.

In 1983, Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School merged with Telok Kurau West School. Two years later, the merged school amalgamated with Telok Kurau East School to form Telok Kurau Primay School as it is known today. The school closed its premises at Joo Chiat Place in 2000 and moved to its current location at 50 Bedok Reservoir Road in 2001, after amalgamating with Bedok Town Primary School. That year, Telok Kurau Primary School also celebrated its 75th anniversary. The school was officially opened in 2002. In 2016, Telok Kurau Primary School celebrated its 90th anniversary.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/telokkuraupri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest shows the letter ‘T’ in the middle of the crest, representing TKPS. The ‘T’ extends with a circle to show a physically and mentally active team constantly and eagerly seeking knowledge. The colour blue represents discipline and stability. Yellow represents creativity, interest and youth. White represents equality and honesty.

The progress of TKPS is depicted by the swoosh and the circle. Pointing to the sky, the symbol indicates that TKPS is moving ahead to a higher level of education. The growing three lines show a growing school constantly improving and upgrading to more achievements. All of the above elements are within a circle representing a learning and nurturing school environment with a stable, solid foundation.
