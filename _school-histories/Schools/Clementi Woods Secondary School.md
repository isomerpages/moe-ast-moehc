#### **School History**
Clementi Woods (CWD) Secondary School was established in 2007 following the merger of Ghim Moh Secondary School and Jin Tai Secondary School. Both Ghim Moh and Jin Tai Secondary School were started in 1976 and 1982 respectively. Clementi Woods Secondary School was located on West Coast Road, at the former premises of Jin Tai Secondary School.

In 2009, the school was officially opened. To unite the school, a pioneers’ pledge was instituted, which students and staff recited during the morning assembly. In 2013, the school vision was refined as Clementi Woods moved into its next phase of development, with the addition of ‘The quest for excellence’ as a desired outcome.

Despite its short history, Clementi Woods Secondary School performed well holistically, inheriting both the academic rigour and the student leadership development programmes from the previous schools. It garnered annual value-added awards in the GCE O-Level examinations. The school also placed equal emphasis on developing moral and social values in students. Its efforts were recognised in 2011 when it won two Development Awards from the Ministry of Education for Character Development and National Education.

The school’s pioneer batch of young entrepreneurs was engaged in the Guppy Hybridisation Programme where they were taught genetics and hybridisation techniques. The students also explored ways to market the guppies.

In 2016, Clementi Woods Secondary School merged with Tanglin Secondary School, taking on the latter’s name.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

This is where, I’m given, the space to grow<br>
A place of learning that stirs my soul<br>
Where ever I go I’ll recall my roots<br>
In my heart forever Clementi Woods

I will learn to love myself and my peers<br>
Treasure my friends throughout the years<br>
For the sake of learning,<br>
I will explore to love wisdom and truth forever more

Hear our song we sing with pride<br>
Resilient through the darkest night<br>
With courage to face the challenges today<br>
And live our lives to the full everyday

Hear our song we sing with pride<br>
Resilient through the darkest night<br>
With courage to face the challenges today<br>
And live our lives to the full everyday<br>
And live our lives to the full everyday
