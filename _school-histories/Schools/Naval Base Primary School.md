#### **School History**
Naval Base Primary School (NBPS) was established in 1988 as a government co-educational school. The school operated from its holding site at Peiying Primary School before moving to its present premises at Yishun Avenue 4 in July 1988.

The first School Advisory Committee was formed in 1990, and NBPS was officially opened the following year. The school was among the first batch of schools to undergo PRIME in 1999. NBPS held a symbolic walk from the holding school at Northbrooks Secondary School back to its current premises on the last day of school in 2001. That same year, the school became single-session.

Golf was introduced as a co-curricular activity in 2003 and was then seen as the school’s niche area under the Programme for School Excellence. NBPS celebrated its 25th anniversary with the Tiger Cubs Challenge, a golf tournament, in 2013. In 2015, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in Holistic Outdoor Physical Education and Sports. The programme aims to develop 21st-century competencies in students. While the school’s core values are strengthened through co-curricular platforms, outdoor adventure experiences build character and qualities that help to foster entrepreneurial dare.

In 2018, Naval Base Primary School underwent PERI upgrading and celebrated its 30th anniversary. The Ministry of Education Kindergarten @ Naval Base will begin operations in 2020.

#### **School Motto**
Work in Harmony

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/navalbasepri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The big circle depicts the all-round education that the school aims to provide for the child.<br>
The anchor denotes strength and depicts the school as a strong base for education.<br>
The letters ‘N’ and ‘B’ stand for Naval Base.  
The school colours are white, red and blue.  
White: purity.<br>
Blue: denotes the colour of the sea-the school being the sea of knowledge which will prepare the students for the future.<br>
Red: the throbbing young blood in the ‘veins’ of the school in the pursuit of knowledge.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Up the gangway, we will go<br>
Ready to achieve our goal<br>
Working together in harmony<br>
On board our Naval Base Primary<br>

Sail On, Sail On<br>
We’ll ride the wildest storm<br>
With our spirits, brave and strong<br>
Soon the gale will be gone<br>

Wave after wave, we will go<br>
Till we hear the shouts of<br>
‘Land Ahoy’<br>
Firm on the anchor of Education<br>
We’ll do our best for our Nation
