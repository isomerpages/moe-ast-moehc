<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Established in the early 1950s, Braddell Rise School was situated next
to Mt Alvernia Hospital at the junction of Thomson Road and Braddell Road.
Many of its students came from nearby Kampung villages including Kampong
San Teng (Bishan), Thomson Road, and Potong Pasir.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school closed sometime between 1986 and 1987. The school building
was renovated and temporarily housed at the Tampines Home a few years later.
The Assisi Hospice is now situated on what used to be Braddell Rise's sports
field. The school's remaining blocks were torn down in 2013 to make way
for the construction of a new six-story Assisi Hospice building.</p>
