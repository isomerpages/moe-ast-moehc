#### **School History**
Edgefield Primary School was established in 2002 in Punggol. The school prides itself as being the first primary school to be established in the Punggol 21 estate. In many ways, the Punggol community and Edgefield Primary School share a similar journey of growth. The school has grown to have over 1,500 students and more than 100 staff members. Encapsulated within Edgefield Primary School’s vision, ‘Lives empowered, Lives touched’, is a strong commitment to inspire staff and students towards the pursuit of educational excellence.

The school’s Learning for Life Programmes (LLP) in Dancesport aims to use basic ballroom dancing to nurture students to be gracious, socially competent and collaborative team players. They are imbued with integrity and respect, and ready to give back to community and society. Another of the school’s LLP, ‘Developing 21st-Century Competencies Through Photography’, beckons the dreamers, explorers and adventurers of today to embark on a journey of self-discovery and photo-journalism.  
  
In 2017, the school started its envisioning exercise to chart future strategic directions for the next five years. 

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Sabrina James (2002–2007)<br>
\- Mr Willy Tan (2008–2014)<br>
