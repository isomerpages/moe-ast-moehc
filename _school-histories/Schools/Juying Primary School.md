#### **School History**
Juying Primary School began as Ju Eng Public School in Jalan Kayu. The school was founded by Mr Ang Oon Hui in 1940 as a Chinese-aided school. The Hanyu Pinyin translation of Ju Eng is ‘Juying’, which means ‘a gathering of talents’.

During the Japanese Occupation, the school was closed, and it opened its doors again in 1945. Ju Eng Public School continued to serve the community until 1987, when it was forced to close its doors due to a dwindling enrolment. However, the spirit of community service lived on, and Mr Ang converted the school building into a home that, provides welfare services for the elderly and needy regardless of race and religion.

The school started functioning again on 3 January 1995 as a government English school. The Ministry of Education decided to retain its name as the school has a long history and good PSLE results.

The new Juying Primary School was officially declared open on 1 August 1997 by Mr Peter Chen, Senior Minister of State for Education and Member of Parliament for Hong Kah GRC. Since its inception, the staff worked relentlessly to ensure that the students had enriching and rewarding experiences. To equip the school with up-to-date facilities to enhance the learning environment for its pupils, the school underwent Phase 1 of the PRIME project which was completed in 2002.&nbsp;

The school underwent another face-lift under PERI upgrading in 2015 to provide additional facilities such as a Band Room, Dance Studio, Teaching Lab and an Indoor Sports Hall, to further support holistic development.&nbsp;In 2015, the school also accorded Environmental Education as its Learning for Life Programme (LLP). Through the environmental inquiry, the school nurtures a sense of wonder in the students and instills in them an abiding sense of care and well-being for their environment. The students make connections with knowledge across subject disciplines, and probe deeper into environmental issues.

In 2018, the school conceptualised tHinkABITS,&nbsp;an&nbsp;Applied Learning Programme (ALP), to promote the acquisition of deep learning competencies and dispositions amongst its students. Equipping learners with these skill sets and positive learning attitudes, they are empowered to take charge of their learning, and it gives every child a strong start in their formative school years.

To realise its vision, the school continues to enliven the students’ learning experiences to prepare them to be Values-driven and Future-ready.&nbsp;

**Bright yellow lettering:**&nbsp;Symbolises boldness and vibrancy.<br>
**Dark green background:**&nbsp;Clean and fresh environment.<br>
**Light green colour:**&nbsp;Reflects the youthful spirit of our students.<br>
**Letters ‘J’, ‘Y, ‘P’ and ‘S’:**&nbsp;Linked gracefully, symbolising unity and harmony within the school.<br>
**Oval shape:**&nbsp;Depicts the integral cohesion of the school, as a harmonious whole. At the same time, the shape is not categorically defined so as to allow flexibility and maneuverability to venture into the horizons and to greater heights, thus consolidating the school’s motto of being at the ‘Acme in Achievement’.

We are the voices of Juying School<br>
Gath’ring our talents to do our part<br>
Trying our best in everyway<br>
Working and striving through every day

With courage and strength<br>
We will persevere<br>
United we stand we shall not fear<br>
And in our hearts we’ll hold Juying dear<br>
And in our hearts we’ll hold Juying dear

We are the pupils learning side by side<br>
Helpful and thoughtful,<br>
We’re happy and keen.<br>
Sharing our knowledge in every way<br>
Learning in both our work and play

(Repeat Chorus)
