#### **School History**
Established in the 1950s, Jervois West Primary School was located along Jervois Road, next to Jervois East Primary School.  
  
In 1986, Jervois West Primary School merged with Jervois East Primary School to form Jervois Primary School. The newly formed Jervois Primary School was located on the Jervois East and West School campuses.  
  
Jervois Primary School closed down in 1989. The Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Jervois Special School used Jervois West Primary Schoolâ€™s building in 1989. APSN Jervois Special School remained there till 2006 when it shifted to a new site in Ang Mo Kio. The school building was subsequently torn down to make way for private housing.
