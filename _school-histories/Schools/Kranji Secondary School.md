#### **School History**
Kranji Secondary School was established in 1995 and temporarily sited in Chestnut Drive Secondary School. In 1996, the school relocated to its present premises at 61 Choa Chu Kang Street 51. The school underwent PRIME upgrading from 2016 to 2018. On 11 December 2018, the school shifted to its new premises.

Since its inception, the school has emphasised on imbibing in students a sense of pride and ownership in community involvement. The school prides itself in its long-term collaboration with Yew Tee Citizens’ Consultative Committee, which started in 2005. It also collaborated with Limbang Citizens’ Consultative Committee in 2018 to celebrate the annual Mid-Autumn Festival. The event saw students set up innovative booths and cultural performances for residents.

In 2014, the school’s continuous efforts to provide students with leadership development and opportunities were recognised with the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Nurturing A Leader in Every Kranjian through Community and Youth Leadership’. Undergirding the programme is the school’s fundamental belief that every individual can be a leader, and the role of the school is to realise and develop the leadership potential in every student through training and opportunities. In 2016, the school launched its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Communities of Reflective and Independent Learners through Thinking Curriculum’.

Kranji Secondary also implemented its customised Thinking Curriculum where thinking routines are taught. The students are exposed to the innovation process and provided with opportunities to apply thinking skills in interdisciplinary project work to help them be future-ready.

The school will be celebrating its 25th anniversary in 2020.

#### **School Motto**
Breakthrough

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/kranjisec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school logo is a circle with pillars within it. Two of the pillars break through at the top right edge of the circumference. The colour red represents the youthful dynamism of the students. While green symbolises the students’ sense of responsibility and respectful attitude, it also represents growth and development.

The five pillars represent the five shared national values that the school wishes to inculcate in the students. The breakthrough at the circle’s circumference symbolises determination and perseverance to excel in academic and co-curricular activities through the shared efforts of students, teachers, parents and the community.

The basic circular green shape indicates the school’s emphasis on the all-round development of the students as well as the school’s commitment to create opportunities for their intellectual, moral, physical, social and aesthetics development through its instructional, enrichment programmes and co-curricular activities.

#### **School Song**

Kranjians take on the challenge to excel in knowledge.<br>
Be creative and uphold integrity,<br>
Kranjians we shall be worthy of nation and family.
  
Eager to learn and succeed.<br>
We build our school on friendship and goodwill,<br>
where students spur each other on to greater heights in life.

Together with our teachers and our parents,<br>
we shall forge a bright tomorrow,<br>
for ourselves and for our children too.<br>
A whole new world in harmony.

Kranjians take on the challenge to excel in knowledge.<br>
Be creative and uphold integrity,<br>
Kranjians we shall be worthy of nation and family.
