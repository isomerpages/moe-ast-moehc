#### **School History**
St Patrick’s School (圣伯特理中学校) is a Lasallian Roman Catholic boys’ secondary school located on East Coast Road. The school was founded in 1933 as a temporary branch school of St Joseph’s Institution. It was built on land acquired by the La Salle Brothers in 1898, which had been intended to be a resort bungalow for the brothers. However, Brother Stephen Buckley saw the population growth in the eastern side of the island and petitioned the La Salle Brothers to build a school on this piece of land. The main school building was completed in 1932, and St Patrick’s became a school in its own right in 1933.

During the Second World War, the school was used by the British as a hospital and later by the Japanese as an administrative building. It was returned to the Brothers in 1946 after the war.

In 1957, the primary section of the school separated and became St Stephen’s School. St Patrick’s became co-educational with the introduction of pre-university classes in 1963, but this was phased out in 1978, and the school returned to being an all-boys school.

St Patrick’s School is affiliated with the four Lasallian primary schools in Singapore – St Joseph’s Institution Junior (formerly St Michael’s School), St Stephen’s School, De La Salle School and St Anthony’s Primary School – as well as St Joseph’s Institution and Catholic Junior College.

#### **School Motto**
Potest Qui Vult

(Latin for ‘He Who Wills, Can’)

The motto is a reminder that, despite human limitations, one can still achieve his ideals if he tries. The Patrician has his feet firmly on the ground as he reaches for the unreachable star.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/stpatrickssch1.jpg">

Three symbols are depicted in the school badge. The green shamrock is a powerful sign of unity in diversity. It was used by St Patrick as a humble image of God. It also represents the earth and the environment. Set against a blue background is the Christian Brothers’ symbol – the radiant star – which conveys the ideals that can be achieved by each student.

All through our college, a voice is resounding,<br>
Promptly respond to your duty's sweet call;<br>
Hearken you all for the trumpet is sounding<br>
Your mater's proclaiming her watch words to all.

Chorus: Forward her children dear<br>
Ever with hearts sincere,<br>
Render with joy to your mater her due!<br>
All that is vile reject,<br>
Heaven will E’er Protect

Son of St Patrick’s valiant and true!<br>
Onward and upwards in life's earnest battle,<br>
Joyously bearing the brunt of the fight<br>
Nobly forgiving for aught that may pain you<br>
And bravely defending the cause of the right.
