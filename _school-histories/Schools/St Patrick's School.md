#### **School History**
The school was founded in 1933 as a temporary branch school of Saint Joseph's Institution, another Catholic boys' school in Singapore. It was built on land acquired by the La Salle Brothers in 1898 which was originally intended for building a resort bungalow. Brother Stephen Buckley saw the population growth in eastern Singapore and petitioned the La Salle Brothers to build a school on that piece of land. The main school building was completed in 1932 and Saint Patrick's became a school in its own right in 1933.

During World War II, the school was used by the British as a hospital and later by the Japanese as an administrative building. It was returned to the La Salle Brothers in 1946.

In 1957, the primary section of the school was separated and became Saint Stephen's School, a primary school for boys.

In 1969, Saint Patrick's became a co-educational school with the introduction of pre-university classes. However, with the phasing out of such classes in 1978, the school returned to being an all-boys school.

Today, Saint Patrick’s School remains proud institution with more than 85 years of history and heritage. Even as we remain rooted in our traditions, values and beliefs, we are committed to constantly evolving in order to best meet the needs of our students.

#### **School Motto**
Potest Qui Vult

(Latin for ‘He Who Wills, Can’)

The motto is a reminder that, despite human limitations, one can still achieve his ideals if he tries. The Patrician has his feet firmly on the ground as he reaches for the unreachable star.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/stpatrickssch1.jpg">

Three symbols are depicted in the school badge. The green shamrock is a powerful sign of unity in diversity. It was used by St Patrick as a humble image of God. It also represents the earth and the environment. Set against a blue background is the Christian Brothers’ symbol – the radiant star – which conveys the ideals that can be achieved by each student.

Nobly forgiving for aught that may pain you<br>
