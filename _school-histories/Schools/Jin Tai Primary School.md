#### **School History**
 Jin Tai Primary School was established in 1982. It was initially housed in the former Jubilee Malay School. The school moved into its new premises in January 1983. The school was officially declared open on 19 September 1984.

The school published a regular newsletter, _TIE_. In 1989, the school set up a farm, called “Jin Tai Farm”, to allow students to experience the joys of growing different plants. The farm included a vivarium, which housed plants and some living organisms, as well as a miniature waterfall.

Like the secondary school, Jin Tai Primary School was known for its achievements in sports, including volleyball and soccer.

In 1991, Jin Tai Primary School introduced Project SOLVE (Strategy on Learning Vocabulary Effectively) to acquire a comprehensive concept in improving students’ retention rate of Chinese characters.

In 2008, Jin Tai Primary School merged with Qifa Primary School.
