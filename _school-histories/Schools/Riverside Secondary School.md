#### **School History**
Riverside Secondary School began as Fuchun Secondary School in 1987 and moved into its present site on 21 December 1987. The school was declared open on 17 July 1990. That year, its first batch of General Certificate of Education N- and O-Level students graduated. The school operated as single-session from 1999. In 2004, Riverside Secondary School completed PRIME upgrading.

Riverside Secondary School was awarded the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course in 2012 and was recertified in 2018. At the Ministry of Education’s Work Plan Seminar in 2015, the school was conferred the School Distinction Award and five Best Practice Awards – Teaching and Learning, Student All-round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, Staff Well-being and Development, and Partnership.

To provide more authentic learning opportunities for its students, Riverside Secondary School offers the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Global Citizenship Education through Critical Social Inquiry’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Arts for Life’.

Riverside Secondary School celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017.

The red circle represents the focal point of the school, which is the all-rounded development of the Riversidian in leadership, aesthetics, meta-cognitive, physical, social and moral aspects. As the Riversidian journeys through the years in Riverside Secondary, he/she will imbibe values and life skills that impel him/her to leap forward and embrace the global challenges of tomorrow.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

In the North where the waters ride high<br>
Stands a school where spirits never die<br>
Committed to build a community<br>
One heart, one mind, one destiny<br>
My best and more,<br>
Believing in our hearts and will<br>
My best and more,<br>
Striving until time stands still<br>
Riverside, far as the eye can see<br>
Making dreams turn into reality<br>
Together in perfect harmony<br>
One will, one road, one eternity<br>
My best and more,<br>
Believing in our hearts and will<br>
My best and more,<br>
Striving until time stands still
