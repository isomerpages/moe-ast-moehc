#### **School Song**
Time waits for no man<br>
Achieve what we can<br>
We need to think and act fast<br>
The present soon becomes the past<br>
So do not delay<br>
There is but one today

Kebun Baru, Kebun Baru<br>
We must achieve more, now or never<br>
Now or never<br>
To do our best for a better Singapore!
