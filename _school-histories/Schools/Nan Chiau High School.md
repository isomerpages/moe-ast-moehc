#### **School History**
Nan Chiau High School was founded as Nan Chiau Teachers’ Training School in 1941 by Chinese businessman, community leader and philanthropist, Mr Tan Kah Kee. Its first campus on Kim Yam Road was built on land donated by Mr Lee Kong Chian. In early 1942, the campus became the headquarters and training grounds for Dalforce, a Chinese volunteer army formed to resist the Japanese invasion. In 1947, Nan Chiau Teachers’ Training School was converted by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan (SHHK) into Nan Chiau Girls’ High School with an ancillary primary school. A female hostel was also built in the 1950s. 

In 1965, the SHHK invested $2 million in rebuilding the school, temporarily relocating the high school to Guillemard Road while the primary school remained at its original site. The new campus was completed in 1969 and was officially opened by Mr. Ong Pang Boon, then Minister for Education, on 8 March 1970. By 1974, the total student enrolment peaked at 2692, with 48 secondary classes and 24 primary classes, prompting a $300, 000 expansion of the school building to add a 5th storey. As Kim Yam Road’s residential area matured, the student enrolment saw a sharp decline. To overcome this, the school went fully co-educational in 1984. 

Nan Chiau Girls’ High School was then renamed Nan Chiau High School. However, the student population continued shrinking in the 1990s. Despite the school’s rich history and the support from the alumni and the SHHK, the school was on the verge of permanent closure. Faced with the dilemma of repurposing the land on Kim Yam Road and hence closing the school, or relocating the school to Sengkang new town, SHHK, the school and its alumni unanimously chose relocation to secure a future for Nan Chiau High School. 

In 2001, the primary and secondary sections were relocated to Sengkang as two separate schools. Nan Chiau High School has continued to develop students holistically and it was recognised as a Special Assistance Plan school in 2012. 

Another milestone came in 2020 when the school was selected as a Chinese Language Elective Programme (CLEP-Sec) school to strengthen the school’s bilingual and bicultural education. To nurture talent in this area, Bilingualism was added as a Direct School Admission (DSA) category, alongside performing arts, sports, and visual arts.

#### **School Motto**
诚毅<br>
Sincerity&nbsp;and&nbsp;Perseverance<br>
Sincerity (诚) means honesty to self and others. Perseverance (毅) implies determination and tenacity in the pursuit of personal growth and academic success.

#### **School Crest**

The crest is represented by three interlocking rings, which symbolise the moral, physical and intellectual development of students. These are intrinsic to the quest for excellence in education. The red colour of the rings signifies a persevering spirit in the pursuit of a bright and promising future, as represented by the golden background. The heart shape in the centre of the overlapping rings symbolises care and concern for the total welfare of the students.
