#### **School History**
Established in 1892, Holy Innocents’ High School was one of the first Chinese mission schools in Singapore. In 1932, Holy Innocents’ Chinese Girls’ School was founded by Rev Father Edward Becheras, Parish Priest of the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The school was then managed by the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus.

In 1985, the primary section of Holy Innocents’ High School and Holy Innocents’ Chinese Girls’ School were amalgamated to form Holy Innocents’ Primary School. The school started functioning with an enrolment of 1,608 students on 25 March 1985 with Ms Goh Boon How as the principal and Mdm Tan Hock Neo as the vice-principal. It was the first Catholic co-educational primary school with modern facilities in Singapore.

The year 1986 saw the last batch of graduands from the Chinese-medium school, and the school became an English-medium school the following year. With its history as a Chinese-medium school and continual efforts in advocating bilingualism, Holy Innocents’ Primary School was designated as a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) school by the Ministry of Education in 1992. 

In 2000, Holy Innocents’ Primary School extended learning beyond the shores of Singapore by providing the students with international immersion trips to China. The scope of its National Chinese Language Competition was broadened with the collaboration of schools in China and Taiwan to become the International Chinese Language Competition. The aim was to promote a love and flair of the written Chinese language. The competition has seen an average of 7,000 entries from schools across Asia in recent years.

For its focus on the learning of Chinese, Holy Innocents’ Primary School was appointed as the Cluster Centre of Excellence for Chinese in 2005. The school celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2010. A Chinese teahouse was opened to mark the school’s commitment in promoting a love for Chinese language and culture through traditional cultural and performing arts. The unique art of _kuaibanshu_ was introduced to students, and it continues to be taught in-house to students.

Presently, Holy Innocents’ Primary School is focused on equipping its students with the skills and aptitudes to meet the challenges of the future. Artistry in Ceramics was offered as a Learning for Life Programme in 2014, and Digiminds@HIPS, which equips students with skills in design thinking, robotics and coding, was introduced in 2015 as the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP).

#### **School Motto**
Sincerity and Charity

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/holyinnocentpri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is shaped like a shield with a cross at the centre.<br>
The shield represents the defence of our faith.<br>
The Cross at the centre signifies the centre place of Christ in our lives.<br>
The red colour of the cross symbolises the blood of Christ and serves to remind us of the supreme sacrifice of Christ for all mankind.  The colour blue, which outlines the shield symbolises the ever-soothing presence of our Mother Mary who is always there for us. The colour white symbolises sincerity and charity.
