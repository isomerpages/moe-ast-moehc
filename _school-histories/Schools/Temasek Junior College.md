#### **School History**
In 1977, upon what was once a hillock in Bedok rose a new government junior college that was named Temasek, which means ‘Sea Town’, the old name for Singapore. The college was named after the nation in the hope of preserving the spirit of old Singapore in a rapidly modernising age. In addition, the name was chosen to honour the nation’s forefathers whose resilience and fortitude had seen Singapore through its early days.

Led by the founding principal, Mr Wee Heng Tin, the pioneer batch of teachers crafted the Temasek Junior College (TJC) motto, ‘For College, For Nation’, to be the clarion call for all TJCians to contribute to the college, the community and our nation.

TJC’s motto still rings true today, as many generations of students continue to make their mark on society through their contributions in diverse fields. As the college continues on its journey of Temasek Excellence, staff and students alike are committed to blaze Temasek’s fame.

TJC was officially declared open in 1977 and is currently located at 22 Bedok South Road.  
  
As part of the MOE College Rejuvenation Programme, TJC will be relocating to the holding site of former TPJC campus ground in 2022, and moving back to its new campus in 2025.

For College, For Nation

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/temasekjc1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The college crest depicts the letters ‘TJC’ in bold form, with the letter ‘T’ taking a symbolic shape and reflecting a characteristic architectural feature of the college. The green background acknowledges the TJC’s alignment with the national objective of projecting a clean and green country. The divisions in the cross of the ‘T’ stand for the five national ideals of justice, equality, happiness, prosperity and progress. The segments in the trunk of the ‘T’ symbolise the four major races working in unison within the college towards the national ideals. The name of the college encircles the crest, flanked by laurels representing the recognition that the college has achieved and is a constant reminder of its commitment to its motto.
