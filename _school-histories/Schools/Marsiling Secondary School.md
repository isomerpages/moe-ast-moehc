#### **School History**
Established in 2000, Marsiling Secondary School began operations from the premises of Woodgrove Secondary School. The school relocated to 12 Marsiling Road in 2002 and had its official opening ceremony in 2003. It gained niche status in environment education and became the Centre of Excellence for the Environment in 2007. For its industrious and creative efforts, the school clinched the President’s Award for the Environment in 2012.

In 2017, the school merged with Si Ling Secondary School to form Marsiling Secondary School. Its Chinese name, 士林中学, is a combination of English and Chinese names from the two schools – reflecting the aim to integrate the aspirations of Si Ling Secondary School as a community of learners and honour the heritage of the Marsiling neighbourhood, where the merged school is located. Students of the merged school are fondly referred to as Marsilians.

Building on these foundations, the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Eco-sustainability through Inquiry-Based Learning’, which was accorded to Marsiling in 2014, was reviewed in 2017. This was done to imbue in students a design thinking mindset and provide a robust interdisciplinary curriculum for students to engage in critical inquiry, coding, hands-on research, and field investigations. In 2018, the Learning for Life Programme in outdoor education, which was accorded to Si Ling in 2014, was renamed ‘Values and Leadership Development through Outdoor Curriculum’ (VALOUR) in response to the school’s strategy of using leadership development to build confidence in students. In addition to outdoor learning opportunities from Secondary One to Secondary Four, every Marsilian has the opportunity to develop his or her leadership skills through one of six student leadership groups in the school.

Make Your Mark

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/marsilingsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The tree represents constant personal growth and resilience. It also symbolises responsibility to the environment and sustainability. The heart, formed by two hands, symbolises respect and care for others, as well as responsibility in carrying out one’s role in the family, school and community. The star stands for the school motto, ‘Make Your Mark’. The elements form an ‘M’ shape, representing Marsiling Secondary School. It also represents the doors of education opening to knowledge, opportunities and the goal of ‘making your mark’ in the world.

The colour gold represents excellence, blue represents professionalism and stability, while red signifies passion. Together they symbolise a balanced, holistic education that empowers students to strive.
