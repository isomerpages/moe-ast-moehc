#### **School History**
    
Woodgrove Primary School commenced operations in January 1999, using the premises of Woodlands Ring Primary School with a total enrolment of 660 students in 17 classes. The school officially moved to its present premises on 5 September 1999.

The first Principal, Mrs Tan Chin Cheoh, started the school in 1999 with only 12 teachers and 5 support staff members until her retirement in 2005 when the enrolment grew to 2650 students. In 2006, Miss Teo Bee Eng was appointed as Principal, and in 2012, Miss Josephine Ng took over the baton. Now, the school has about 90 teachers. The current principal, Mrs Adeline Ng has headed the school since 2021.

The school’s Strategic Thrusts focuses on the provision of a holistic education through developing a Learner-Centred and caring community as it believes that children learn best when they are meaningfully engaged, challenged yet supported in school and are given opportunities to play an active part in the community they are part of. The school will continuously improve the quality and range of school experiences through developing staff capacity and improving the learning environment. The school will build on its partnership with parents and other stakeholders so that together, we can bring out the best in our woodgrovians, developing them into;

Future-Ready Lifelong Learners, Resilient and Courageous Leaders, Responsible and Active Contributors and Committed and Concerned Citizens.
