#### **School History**
In the early 1940s, before the Second World War, a group of public-spirited villagers started Fu Hua School. The school was located at Jurong Road, 15th Milestone, opposite the British Military Camp, in the vicinity of the present Nanyang Technological University.

After the Japanese Occupation, in 1947, Mr Tan Ghim Hua, Mr Ng Sei Keong, Mr Goh Choon Leng, Mr Wu Bi Chen, Mr Ng Ni Jiang and other education enthusiasts initiated the reopening of the school. The school was renamed Fu Hua Public School (公立辅华学校), a Chinese-medium school. Mr Huang Choon Chai was appointed principal, and he along with two other teachers made up the staff strength. The school’s survival was made possible through the tenacious spirit of the school’s founding members, who believed that education was the primary means through which the children could move up the social economic strata and have a bright future.

Fu Hua Public School became a government-aided school in the late 1960s. Mr Goh Chye Huat, son of Mr Goh Choon Leng, was one of those involved in the rebuilding of the school. The school was largely funded by donations to the school board. In December 1983, it was closed to make way for development.

On 2 January 1984, the school was relocated to its present site at Jurong East Street 13 as a government English school and was renamed Fuhua Primary School. At the time, the school’s mission was ‘Fuhua Primary School – Where Children Start to Grow’. The school was officially opened on 18 July 1986.&nbsp;

The school’s Applied Learning Programme focuses on the integration of two important 21st-century competencies: computational thinking and thinking skills, which are taught in a school-wide project work programme. Students have the opportunity to apply the skills in authentic scenarios or real-world problems. These skills are scoped across all six levels in a progressive manner, moving from basic skills in Primary One and Two to advanced skills development in Primary Five and Six.

A school-wide six-year Environment Education Programme, part of the Learning for Life Programme, seeks to nurture socially responsible individuals. It is designed and scoped to allow students to participate in various activities within and outside school with an expanding sphere of involvement as they progress through the levels. The programme aims to develop student leaders to champion environmental efforts through the ACE tiered structure. ‘A’ stands for (environmental) Ambassadors, ‘C’ for (environmental) Champions and ‘E’ for (environmental) Enthusiasts.

The school completed its PERI upgrading in 2018. It is now equipped with the latest infrastructure such as an indoor sports hall, a teaching laboratory, a tinker lab, and a maker studio and space.

The school badge has two colours: beige and chocolate brown. The earthy colours signify the dignity of labour and the cultivation of the correct attitude in the use of our hands. The badge incorporates the letters F &amp; H, the initials of the school and the school motto: FRUGALITY AND HONESTY. The whole design is enclosed in a ring and it depicts the strong character of the school, working together as a team in unity and harmony, continual growth, and development of the school.
