#### **School History**
Founded in 1862 by Reverend Edward Sherman Venn, St Andrew’s School was the first Anglican boys’ school in Singapore. The humble, small, semi-private institution has since grown from strength to strength.

The school has moved five times to better provide for the increasing enrolment. In 2006, it moved to its current premises, which brought all the schools in the St Andrew’s family under one roof at St Andrew’s Village. Campus enhancements included the construction of a swimming pool, an artificial grass pitch for rugby and an artificial turf for hockey. To support the growth of the school’s athletes, there is an in-house physiotherapy clinic and gym. As of 2019, the school boasts an indoor sports hall that is double the capacity of a regular hall to cater to the schools in St Andrew’s Village.

The curriculum and activities have also been developed and refined to bring out the best in the students. These include customised courses and approaches that are tailored to students’ learning needs and preferences in the various streams. Leveraging on its location by the Kallang River, one of the school’s key programmes, River Studies, supports learning beyond the classroom and teaches the importance of environmental conservation.

St Andrew’s School has a long tradition of sporting excellence. In 2004, the school gained niche status in rugby. In view of the school’s sound sports programme, St Andrew’s was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Sports for Life’, in 2014. The programme inculcates life skills and values in the students to serve society while encouraging them to lead an active lifestyle. In the following year, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in engineering and robotics. Through this programme, students apply logical reasoning and design thinking in their projects, and sharpen their critical and creative thinking abilities in the process.

The arts have always been an integral part of the Saints’ experience. The school introduces initiatives that excite and engage the students in developing their appreciation of the arts, such as the annual Arts and Design Festival, performing arts concerts and hall assembly programmes.

St Andrew’s offers a holistic education that nurtures all-rounded Saints: servant leaders who bring life to the nations.

Burning brightly ever.
