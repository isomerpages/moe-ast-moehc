#### **School History**
Established in 1961, Labrador Primary School was located at Pasir Panjang Road. The school was officially opened on 28 October 1961. Labrador Primary School offered English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil language streams.  
  
Labrador Primary School’s enrolment rates fell over time. By 1987, there were only 575 students. In 1988, the school closed  and its remaining students were transferred to Jagoh Primary School. The building was left vacant for several months. From June 1989 to 2000, the school building was used by Singapore Polytechnic as a temporary location for its Business Administration course. Since 2001, the site has been used by the Bayanihan Centre.
