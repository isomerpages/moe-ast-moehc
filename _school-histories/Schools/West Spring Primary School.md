#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/westspringpri1.png">

The school crest shows the image of a jumping human figure that is full of joy and vitality. The human figure is formed by the letters ‘W’ and ‘S’, the initials of West Spring Primary. The changing shades of blue from the left to the right symbolise the transformational process of an education at the school, one that metamorphoses students from diamonds in the rough to bright and vibrant personalities. The green dot at the top illuminates the rise of such potential, which will always sparkle and shine brightly in society.

The flow of turquoise hues throughout the logo carries with it the imagery of flowing spring water, and brings to life the Chinese idiom 饮水思源 (yǐn shuǐ sī yuán), which literally means that we should remember the source as we take our drink. This spirit of remembering our origins and appreciating what we have is the hallmark of all students at the school. It is a spirit of gratitude that will always prevail even as students graduate and move on to scale higher peaks in life.

#### **School Song**

Every day that I wake<br>
I’m thankful for this day<br>
I’ve got joy in my heart<br>

Every step that I take<br>
every move I make<br>
You’ll be there to guide my way<br>
on this beautiful day

It’s here where we will learn<br>
we’ll work towards our goals<br>
It’s here with dreams and hopes<br>
we call our second home<br>
We’ll sing out loud and proud<br>
let our light shine through<br>
I’ll care for you and you’ll care for me<br>
I love my school<br>
