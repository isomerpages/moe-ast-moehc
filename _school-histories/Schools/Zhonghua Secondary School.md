#### **School History**
Established in 1911, Chung Hwa Girls’ School was the first Chinese-medium girls’ school in Singapore. In 1951, the primary school section separated from the secondary school section. The latter was known as Chung Hwa Girls’ High School, located on Bartley Road. In 1957, the school became government-aided.

In 1980, Chung Hwa Girls’ High School received its first intake of English-medium students. The school became co-educational and a full-fledged government school known as Chung Hwa High School in 1984. It was renamed Zhonghua Secondary School and moved to Serangoon Avenue 4 in 1987.

In 1996, Zhonghua Secondary School gained autonomous status. The school relocated to Serangoon Avenue 3 in 2000. Zhonghua Secondary School also became the Centre of Excellence for Visual Arts, with the official opening of the Art Gallery and Centre in 2005. It is also the first co-educational school to offer the Art Elective Programme in 2010 to help students realise their artistic potential.

In 2013, Zhonghua Secondary School became the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Science. The school retained its autonomous status from 2015 to 2020. Its signature programmes&nbsp;which&nbsp;are integrated under three broad strands of education, namely&nbsp;Science and Technology Education, Environmental and Sustainability Education, and Glocal Perspectives Education, develop and equip students with 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/zhonghuasec1.jpg">

The school crest takes the shape of a begonia leaf. The begonia has dark green leaves and produces red flowers. It is a hardy plant that survives naturally in almost any kind of condition. The colour green signifies freshness, youth, growth, life, vitality and resilience. The colour white is the emblem of purity, virtue and brightness.

Students are encouraged to emulate the enduring qualities of the begonia –&nbsp;to be&nbsp;steadfast,&nbsp;strong, determined and decisive.&nbsp;Students are also encouraged to cultivate qualities such as&nbsp;excellence, endurance, hope and goodness.
