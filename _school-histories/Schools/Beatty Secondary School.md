#### **School History**
Established in 1953, Beatty Secondary School started as a co-educational school situated near the former Rumah Miskin Police Station along Serangoon Road. The school began with 323 students in eight classes: three Standard Six classes from Bartley Secondary School, three Standard Seven and two Standard Eight classes from Victoria Continuation School. In January 1954, it saw the inclusion of students from Gan Eng Seng School and Serangoon Continuation School. The population grew to 928 students in 23 classes. 

In 1956, the afternoon classes were moved to Kwong Avenue Primary School. In the same year, the girls were transferred to Cedar Girls’ Secondary School, and Beatty Secondary became a full-fledged all-boys secondary school. Twenty students from Chinese Middle School were also admitted to the post-school certificate class, which marked the beginning of pre-university education in Beatty Secondary.

Over the years, the student population greatly increased, and the old school premises and facilities became inadequate for both staff and students. In March 1982, the old Beatty Secondary School moved to its current premises in Toa Payoh and was officially opened on 26 July 1983. In the same year, girls were enrolled in the school. In 1991, the school saw the graduation of its last batch of pre-university students. 

In 2015, Beatty Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Beattyians Think. Create. Innovate’, which focuses on science, technology, engineering and mathematics_._ It aims to nurture thinkers, learners and contributors. In the same year, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) called ‘Beatty’s Leaders for Life’_._ Beyond imparting content knowledge and skills, the school strongly believes in inculcating values that will prepare Beattyians for the future. Under the LLP, student leaders develop effective leadership skills, resilience, teamwork, a greater sense of global awareness and rootedness – traits that are necessary for navigating life in the 21st century.

In 2017, Beatty Secondary School merged with Balestier Hill Secondary School, and the merged school operates from the premises at 1 Toa Payoh North. Following the merger, Beatty Secondary School was designated as the secondary school for students with hearing loss, who learn using the signing system.

#### **School Motto**
_Non Vi Sed Arte_

The motto is Latin for ‘Not With Force But With Skill’_._ The phrase was derived from the coat of arms of Admiral Earl David Beatty, after whom the school was named.

#### **School Crest**

The colours on the crest, which are the colours of Admiral Earl David Beatty, symbolise unity. The beehive, surrounded by buzzing bees, is derived from Admiral Beatty’s coat of arms. The school crest symbolises the hard work that has to be put in to achieve success.
