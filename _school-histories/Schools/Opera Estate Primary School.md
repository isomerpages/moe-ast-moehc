#### **School History**
Opera Estate Primary School (OEPS) was established in 1985 with the amalgamation of Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School and Opera Estate Girls’ Primary School to become a government co-educational school. The school was then operating at the site of the old Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School. The school underwent PRIME upgrading in 2001 and was relocated to a holding site along New Upper Changi Road before moving back to the current site at Fidelio Street in June 2003. It started operating in a single session in 2004. The school held its 20th anniversary cum opening ceremony on 11 March 2005. 

In 2014, the school was conferred the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the area of aesthetics. Known as ‘Ignite D’Arts@OEPS’, the programme provides opportunities for students to have a deeper appreciation for the arts and music. In 2017, the school was accorded a second LLP in student leadership, ‘Learn to Lead, Lead to Serve’.

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Come let’s learn together in this happy loving school.<br>
Years pass with mem’-ries as we leave this jolly group.<br>
There is work of many sorts we all must take our share.<br>
The future’s bright for us as we strive for the glorious goal.<br>
Come let’s live together as a happy family.<br>
At work or in play we should try to help each other.<br>
We must be united in all our endeavours.<br>
The future’s bright for us as we strive for the glorious goal.
