#### **School History**
Opera Estate Primary School (OEPS) was established in 1985 with the amalgamation of Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School and Opera Estate Girls’ Primary School to become a government co-educational school. The school was then operating at the site of the old Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School. The school underwent PRIME upgrading in 2001 and was relocated to a holding site along New Upper Changi Road before moving back to the current site at Fidelio Street in June 2003. It started operating in a single session in 2004. The school held its 20th anniversary cum opening ceremony on 11 March 2005.&nbsp;

In 2014, the school was conferred the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in the area of aesthetics. Known as ‘Ignite D’Arts@OEPS’, the programme provides opportunities for students to have a deeper appreciation for the arts and music. In 2017, the school was accorded a second LLP in student leadership, ‘Learn to Lead, Lead to Serve’.

Come let’s learn together in this happy loving school.<br>
Years pass with mem’-ries as we leave this jolly group.<br>
There is work of many sorts we all must take our share.<br>
The future’s bright for us as we strive for the glorious goal.<br>
Come let’s live together as a happy family.<br>
At work or in play we should try to help each other.<br>
We must be united in all our endeavours.<br>
The future’s bright for us as we strive for the glorious goal.
