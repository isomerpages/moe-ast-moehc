#### **School History**
Pei Hwa Secondary School was established in January 2005 and officially opened on 28 July 2007. During the opening ceremony, the school’s time capsule comprising its first set of memorabilia – such as its uniform, handbook, music score of the school song, and newsletter – was sealed. It will be opened during the school’s silver jubilee celebration in 2030. The school also launched the Jalan Kayu Heritage Trail to preserve the history of the neighbouring community as part of its official opening. This trail was later identified as one of the SG50 heritage trails.

Over the years, the school has developed various platforms to provide a holistic and engaging educational experience for its students, including place-based learning at Punggol River as part of School Curriculum Innovation (which has since been integrated and renamed as Project Work in 2019) and the biennial public performance PHiesta first held in 2009. In 2011, the school launched the inaugural biennial Community Day as part of the students’ Service Learning Experience.

In 2014, Pei Hwa was one of the 12 pilot schools to implement Subject-based Banding. The school’s Applied Learning Programme is in robotics and programming, with a science, technology, engineering and mathematics focus. Its Learning for Life Programme is in community youth leadership, titled ‘PRIDE of the Community: Developing Altruists’.

Pei Hwa celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2015. In 2017, the school further refined its mission with the focus, ‘To develop innovative and compassionate citizens’, in alignment with the Ministry of Education’s desired outcomes of education for students to be future-ready. The following year saw the completion of the indoor sports hall.

#### **School Motto**
Nurturing Talents

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/peihwasec1.jpg">

The logo comprises the Chinese characters of the school name, 培 (Pei) and 华 (Hwa), which means ‘nurturing talents’. Central to the logo is the figure representing a resilient Pei Hwa student who is happy and confident as he or she overcomes each obstacle. The figure is upright (as shown by the 立 character at the top of the figure’s head) and grounded (as shown by the 土 character) in values. An education in Pei Hwa has enabled the individual to embrace the world of knowledge with open arms and to push beyond current boundaries.
