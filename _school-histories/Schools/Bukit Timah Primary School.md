#### **School Crest**

The school crest consists of a human figure with outstretched arms, and a peak of excellence balancing a circle of all roundness against a blue background.  
  
The blue background denotes the depth of the oceans and the learning offers. Gold symbolizes the richness that will be experienced when the peak of excellence is attained.  
  
The human figure stands for a person robust in mind and body as he balances academic and CO-curricular achievements in the course of his education.  
  
Together, they depict Bukit Timah Primary School’s Motto – STRIVE FOR THE BEST
