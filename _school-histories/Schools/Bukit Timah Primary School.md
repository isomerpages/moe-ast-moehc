#### **School History**
Bukit Timah Primary School was formerly known as Bukit Batok Primary School, which was situated at the junction of Jalan Jurong Kechil and Jurong Road. Bukit Batok Primary School had been established in 1984 as a merger school of Bukit Batok East Primary School and Bukit Batok West Primary School.   
  
In December 2001, Bukit Batok Primary School relocated to new premises at Lorong Kismis and was renamed Bukit Timah Primary School.  
  
The school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Inquiry-Based Learning – Thinking Routines in 2014, where students learn thinking routines to articulate their thoughts and develop effective communication skills. In 2015, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in Music – Music Around Us, where all students were equipped with basic music theory, and given opportunities to perform individually and as an ensemble.
