#### **School History**
Innova Junior College was established in 2005 at 21 Champions Way. In the following year, the college was selected as a centre for the Language Elective Programme (Malay Language and Literature). It was also awarded the LeadIT@Schools scheme to spearhead the use of information and communications technology to enhance teaching and learning. In 2007, Innova Junior College was designated as a Centre of Excellence for New Media. It was officially declared open that same year.

The college offered an in-house Global Immersion and Exchange Programme that provided Innovians with the opportunity to forge friendships across national borders and to appreciate the real-world application of lessons in the classroom. It also offered the Innova Scholars Programme that equipped Innovians with the skills to compete for university scholarships, with activities like internships and interview skills workshops.

Innova focused on develop leaders with sound values, judgement and foresight. A progressive Leadership Index was used as a guide for each student to develop in the domains of intellectual capacity, teamwork and drive. In 2011, the chaNgE.PACER Council was set up to develop empathetic leaders who would advocate for communities in need. These academic and co-curricular programmes demonstrated the college’s commitment to equipping Innovians with a comprehensive set of skills to be capable leaders, astute thinkers and confident global citizens.

In 2015, Innova celebrated its 10th anniversary with a night festival attended by alumni and students. The highlight of the evening was an original musical by the school’s performing arts groups. 

In 2019, Innova Junior College merged with Yishun Junior College to form Yishun Innova Junior College.

The star in the crest signifies that every Innovian is like a star in pursuit of his or her passion, while the wave represents the college’s commitment to be lifelong learners. The sail symbolises the drive towards achieving one’s goals.

Blue is the colour of the sky, symbolising the college’s aim for its students to reach for the sky and aim for the stars. The colour orange represents passion – the college believes that everyone has dreams and should pursue them. The colour maroon represents knowledge and creativity in Innovians.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We stand together<br>
Championing change, we can succeed<br>
In this world we wish to lead<br>
Passion’s the answer<br>
Giving our souls the strength we need<br>
As we conquer every peak

The lessons we learn the champions’ way<br>
Enriching our lives determined to grow<br>
Day by day

Let’s follow our dreams Innova<br>
Together we’ve come this far<br>
And with what we’ve learnt we’ll tell the world<br>
We’re reaching for the skies<br>
Ad Astra! We’ll touch the stars

Innova aspire<br>
Let’s be the star for all to see<br>
In our goals we must believe<br>
Reaching up higher,<br>
Blazing the skies with all our dreams<br>
Innova, we will achieve

Repeat Bridge<br>
Repeat Chorus
