#### **School History**
CHIJ Our Lady Queen of Peace is one of the 11 schools set up by the Infant Jesus (IJ) Sisters in Singapore. CHIJ (Our Lady Queen of Peace), formerly known as CHIJ Bukit Timah, was the seventh school to be founded by the IJ Sisters in 1955. It started with 62 pupils housed temporarily at the St Joseph Sino-English School. It moved to its present premises at Chestnut Drive in 1957.  
  
In 1961, a secondary section was started, but in 1973, because of the inadequate facilities for secondary education, the secondary section moved out and amalgamated with the secondary section of Boys’ Town School.  
  
From January 1975, the school functioned as a full primary school. The school was rebuilt under PRIME from June 2005 to June 2007, following which it returned to its new campus at Chestnut Drive. New facilities included up-to-date physical infrastructure and facilities to provide a better environment for the pupils to learn and develop their potential. There were more computer laboratories, new IT resource rooms, bigger classrooms and a better-equipped media resource library, a new health and fitness room, counselling room, prayer room, math room and science rooms.  
  
The school embarked on PERI Upgrading in 2016, and it was completed in 2018. The upgrading saw a new seven-storey block erected with added facilities to enhance the students’ learning experiences as well as an outdoor experiential learning space, jogging path and outdoor fitness playground.

#### **School Motto**
Simple Dans Ma Vertu, Forte Dans Devoir (French Version)<br>
Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty (English Version)&nbsp;  
  
To be&nbsp;**Simple in Virtue**&nbsp;is to cultivate a personal honesty which frees us to relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity and to become disinterested seekers of truth, wisdom and all that is good.&nbsp; It is the core from which we operate.  
  
To be&nbsp;**Steadfast in Duty**&nbsp;is to have the strength of character necessary to commit oneself to a goal. It embraces the capacity to rise above the difficulties and obstacles encountered in the execution and completion of any task or duty undertaken in the service of others.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/chijpeace1.jpg">

The CHIJ badge or crest (called the Blason, in French) was designed by Mother Saint Aloysia and the CHIJ senior students in 1894 in France incorporating into its concept and design, values and aspirations which they wished to be lived out in each CHIJ School. Their design is still proudly worn by thousands of CHIJ students in the 21st century. This badge is a symbol of the international unity binding together students from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Japan.&nbsp;  
  
At the centre of the school crest lies a red shield with a silver band edged in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of Gospels with a silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield, surmounted by a gold cross, is encircled by a garland of marguerites. Emblazoned on the crest is the motto of all CHIJ schools:-

<figure><figcaption><strong>  
Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty

The open&nbsp;**Gospel**&nbsp;points to the source of inspiration which guides the whole school community. The&nbsp;**silver rosary**&nbsp;represents the story of the Gospel as seen through the eyes of Virgin Mary.&nbsp;  
  
The&nbsp;**golden distaff**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**spindle**&nbsp;are symbols of womanly labour, typical of an earlier period, which remind us of the dignity of work and the satisfaction and fulfilment to be found in a task well-accomplished.&nbsp;  
  
The cross which surmounts the crest serves as a reminder that the source of our inspiration, dedication and fidelity comes from Christ.&nbsp;  
  
The&nbsp;**red shield is encircled by a garland of marguerites**. These simple flowers are found by the wayside in France and are symbolic of the purity and simplicity which should characterize our relationships at every level.
