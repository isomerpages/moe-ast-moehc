#### **School History**
CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity is one of the 11 schools set up by the Infant Jesus (IJ) Sisters in Singapore. Originally known as CHIJ Ponggol, it was renamed CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity in January 2001.

In the mid-1950s, Rev. Mother St John, who was then the IJ Reverend Mother Superior, realised the pressing need for an English-medium girls’ school in Ponggol. The Archbishop of Singapore provided land for the project, and CHIJ Punggol was thus set up in 1957. 

At its inception, the school in Ponggol came under the wing of St Joseph’s Convent. The first class of the school started in January 1957, well before the school building was actually completed. This was a Primary One class taught by Ms Magdalene Goh, a teacher from St Joseph’s Convent, and the class was located in Holy Innocents’ Chinese Girls’ School. Over the year, this one class grew into three; by the time the school building was ready at the end of the year, the three classes were ready to move in. 

Over the next 60 years, the school grew, both physically and in terms of enrolment. This resulted in it acquiring first a building vacated by Holy Innocents’ Girls’ School in January 1988 and then in December 2000, moving into a new school building built at the former Montfort School site on Upper Serangoon Road. Later in 2019, the school completed another building project to provide its students with an additional classroom annex and an indoor sports hall.  Through the years, the school population has grown from its initial class of 38 pupils in 1957 to its current 1,424 girls in 44 classes.

However, throughout all its physical changes, one thing always remains constant: the school remains focused on providing a nurturing and supportive learning environment where its pupils are developed to their fullest potential through learning experiences and programmes with strong emphasis on character development and alignment with the IJ Mission. Embodying the IJ Spirit, students of CHIJ Our Lady of the Nativity are ready to serve others and make a difference.

#### **School Motto**
_Simple Dans Ma Vertu, Forte Dans Devoir (French Version)<br>
_Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty (English Version)_

To be **Simple in Virtue** is to cultivate a personal honesty which helps us relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity. Virtue is nobleness of character nurtured by a genuine desire to live according to God’s will as revealed in the Gospel.

To be **Steadfast in Duty** is to be faithful in fulfilling our obligations and having the capacity to rise above difficulties or obstacles to execute and complete a task in the service of others.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/chijnativity1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The CHIJ badge or crest (called the Blason, in French) was designed by Mere Saint Aloysia, Superior General (1877 – 1901) and her senior students of 1894.

At the centre of the school crest lies a red shield with a silver band edged in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of Gospels with a silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield, surmounted by a gold cross, is encircled by a garland of marguerites. Emblazoned on the crest is the motto of all CHIJ schools:-

Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty

The **cross** is the symbol of our salvation and the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The open **Gospel** represents the teachings of Christ and is a source of inspiration that guides the school community. The **silver** **rosary** symbolizes prayer and is the story of the Gospel as seen through the eyes of Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

The **golden distaff** and **spindle** are symbols of womanly labour and remind us of the dignity of work and the satisfaction and fulfilment to be found in a task well-accomplished.

The **red shield** symbolizes God’s all-embracing message of love.

The garland of **marguerites** is symbolic of purity and simplicity – charming traits of girlhood.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

CHIJ is our school<br>
In our hearts we hold you dear<br>
And from your guidance seek and find<br>
A future far beyond<br>
In the years that are to be<br>
We shall often think of thee<br>
The marguerite and distaff bold<br>
Emblems of our school motto<br>
They our guide shall be<br>
In all our future years<br>
Simple in virtue, steadfast in duty<br>
The motto of our school<br>
Let's strive our best and honour her name
