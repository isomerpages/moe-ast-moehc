The School Logo is a simple but meaningful design, bearing the initials of the School – EP.

In the centre of the Logo is an oval-shaped athletic track which symbolises the unending development of the PHYSICAL, MENTAL, MORAL and SOCIAL facets of the individual student. It implies the EDUCATION OF THE PHYSICAL THROUGH THE PHYSICAL.

The oval-shaped track also symbolises the endeavour for the continuous PROGRESS IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE and the LIFE-LONG PROCESS of EDUCATION.

#### **School Song**
We pupils of East Payoh<br>
Take pride in doing our best<br>
In everything that we attempt<br>
We strive that we will win the test<br>
With eagerness to work hard and teachers to help us<br>
We promise that we will not fail<br>
To keep our goal is sharp focus

We’re here to get an education<br>
We’re here to prepare for life<br>
But all that we can achieve<br>
Depends on what we can imbibe<br>
The path that is before us<br>
Is not an easy one<br>
But with our full determination<br>
The prize before us will be won.
