#### **School History**
Jurong Town Primary School was officially declared open on 28 March 1968. It was located at the junction of Corporation Drive and Hu Ching Road.

The rapid growth and expansion of the Jurong Industrial Estate saw a peak in the school population in 1971, with 3,000 students. To accommodate the students, the school built a new block and used 10 classrooms in Jurong Secondary School to conduct their lessons.

The school took pride in moulding its students in becoming responsible and caring citizens through moral education and lifeskills programmes. The school also implemented a Buddy Reading Scheme, in which older students helped the weaker students in the lower classes to improve their reading skills.

In the 1980s, Malay stream students were transferred to Merlimau Primary School. In 1986, the final batch of Chinese stream students sat for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Jurong Town Primary School also became an English-medium school.

In 2003, Jurong Town Primary School merged with Merlimau Primary School and Yung An Primary School to become Lakeside Primary School.
