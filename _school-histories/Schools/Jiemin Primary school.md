#### **School History**
The name of the school, Jiemin, originates from two traditional Chinese schools, Jiegu and Quanmin public schools, which were functioning at Bukit Merah before their closure in 1984. Jiemin Primary School began operations at Yishun Street 71 in January 1985. The school was also the holding site for 16 classes from Peixin Primary School, which later shifted into their own premises at Yishun Ring Road in June 1985. In March 1985, another 13 classes from West Hill Primary School joined the school. The school was officially opened in 1987 and celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2015.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme – Our Journalists in Making – aims to develop students in critical thinking, oral and written communication skills and build their confidence to speak and write on any chosen topic. Presentations held during recess and school events are platforms that build students’ confidence. Students who would like to learn more about journalism can participate in the Journalists’ Club where they attend workshops and participate in activities such as reporting real-time news during school events.

Through the school’s Learning for Life Programme, Aesthetics Alive, students learn to draw, play instruments, compose songs and appreciate music and art through its structured art and music curricula. Students are also provided with opportunities to experiment with different musical instruments and dances during recess. Students who have a flair for dancing and music can participate in performing arts co-curricular activities such as Modern Dance and Angklung Ensemble, where more specific skills are taught and students can also develop team spirit and leadership qualities.
