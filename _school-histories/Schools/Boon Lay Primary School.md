#### **School History**
Boon Lay Primary School, also known as Boon Lay School, was established in 1953 at Jalan Boon Lay Lama. It functioned as a single session school with an enrolment of 208 students in six classes. In the late 1950s, the school became a double-session school.

In December 1983, the school relocated to Jurong East Street 32.

The school performed especially well at chess. One of its best chess players, Loh Xiao Wei, was the youngest female winner at the 1994 National Championship.

In 2006, Boon Lay Primary School merged with Jurong Primary School.

The colour **red** is symbolic of universal brotherhood and equality, and the colour **white** signifies purity in thoughts and actions. The colours coincide with the national colours of Singapore, as the future and aspirations of the school are intertwined with those of the nation.

The **four parallel wavy lines** represent the four races striving together with equal opportunity to attain knowledge, which is symbolised by the light of the torch.

With joy in our hearts we unite to sing<br>
In praise of our Boon Lay School<br>
In work and play we’ll always strive<br>

And show respect to all we meet<br>
With ready minds and willing hands<br>
To uphold your name will be our aim

The glorious light of Boon Lay<br>
Steadfast may it shine far and near<br>
Arise together and sing with cheer<br>
Behold the light of Boon Lay School
