#### **School History**
Established in 1957, West Hill School was located at the now defunct Bah Tan Road.

On 4 January 1985, the school building and its facilities were damaged by a storm. This prompted the school to temporarily share premises with neighbouring Canberra Primary School. However, West Hill School’s building was rendered unsafe and beyond repair. The school closed with effect from 15 March 1986. West Hill School’s students joined Canberra School and Jiemin School in Yishun.

After West Hill School’s closure and demolition of its school building, Naval Base Secondary School occupied the land until 1988. Since the 1990s, the Sembawang MRT Station lies on the site.

Principals:<br>
