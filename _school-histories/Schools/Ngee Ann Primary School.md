#### **School History**
Ngee Ann Primary School was formerly known as Ngee Ann Girls’ School. In 1940, Ngee Ann Kongsi’s board of directors – comprising Mr Lee Wee Nam, Mr Yeo Chan Boon, Mr Lim Kim Seng and a few others – set up the school to promote education for girls.

The school was located in a bungalow at 229 River Valley Road, owned by a Kongsi member. The site is where Teo Yeonh Huai Kuan stands today. During the Japanese Occupation, the girls’ school was closed, and it reopened after the war in the mid-1950s. English became the medium of instruction for mathematics and science.

In 1967, the school started accepting male students and refocused its activities to become a co-educational primary school. In 1980, the school was renamed Ngee Ann Primary School. In 1982, the school relocated to its current premises in Marine Parade. On 30 March 1984, the school was officially declared opened.

Ngee Ann Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘GRaciousness through Arts, Creating Excellence (GRACE) Programme’ and attained the Best Practice Award (BPA) for Student All-Round Development in 2016.

In 2019, the school garden, L.I.F.E. @ Ngee Ann, was officially launched. L.I.F.E (Learning, Inquiring, Flourishing, Exploring) @ Ngee Ann is an outdoor exploratory garden for learning to come alive beyond the classrooms. 2020 marks the school’s 80th anniversary.

The school crest is in the shape of a shield. There are three lines on the crest signifying the close relationship of the school, the home and the community. In the middle of the crest are traditional Chinese characters for ‘Ngee Ann’, symbolising the link of the school to its history. Beneath the crest is the name of the school in English and the school motto ‘Onward in Unity’. It is a reminder to its students that they should always persevere and never give up hope.
