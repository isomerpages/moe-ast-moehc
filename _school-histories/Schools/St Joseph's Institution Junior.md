#### **School History**
St Joseph’s Institution Junior School is one of the six Christian Brothers’ School (CBS) of the De La Salle order in Singapore. The school was formerly known as St Michael’s School (SMS), named after Brother Ascislus Michael, the then Director of St Joseph’s Institution whose patron saint was St Michael the Archangel. St Michael symbolically represents the champion in the struggle against evil. The school was located along Moulmein Road. Over the years, the main entrance of the school at Moulmein Road was relocated to Essex Road.

On 11 January 1954, the school started with 590 students. In the early years, St Joseph’s Afternoon School shared the same premises as St Michael’s School. In 1961, St Joseph’s Afternoon School moved to Bras Basah Road and St Joseph’s Junior moved in. It merged with St Michael’s School to become SMS I and SMS II in 1965.

In 1982, the school made plans to rebuild its premises in order to cater to the ever-increasing enrolment of Michaelians. In 1987, half of the school population moved to the Gentle Road holding site. In 1989, the whole school moved, this time to Rangoon Road where they stayed until 1990 for the rebuilding of the new St Michael’s School on Essex Road. On 4 January 1991, the school returned to its new building.

On 26 November 1999, the school relocated temporarily while the Essex Road campus was upgraded under PRIME to equip the school with the latest facilities. In 2007, after a year of consultation among stakeholders, St Michael’s School was officially renamed St Joseph’s Institution Junior.

In November 2011, the school relocated again to facilitate the PERI upgrading works. The school returned to a new indoor sports hall and other new facilities at Essex Road in June 2013.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/stjosephinstitutionjr1.png">

Following the name change from St Michael’s School to St Joseph’s Institution Junior School in 2007, the school adopted the school crest of St Joseph’s Institution.

The green field of the crest is divided into four quadrants by a white cross, the symbol of the Christian faith. In the centre of the cross lies the logo of the Brothers, a five-pointed star, the&nbsp;_Signum Fidei_. It originated from the Star of Bethlehem, which led the Magi (wise men of the East) to the birth of Christ. In fact, the&nbsp;_Signum Fidei_&nbsp;(the Sign of Faith) is the motto of the Christian Brothers of St John Baptist De La Salle. It reminds all Josephians to centre their lives on faith and to reach always for the reachable star of their convictions and ideals. In the top quadrant are three interlocking circles, symbolising games and the sporting spirit of all Josephians. In the top-right quadrant is the lamp of knowledge on a book, which is a symbol of learning. The lion at the bottom-left quadrant represents the courage and determination with which Josephians face the many challenges of life. It is also a reminder that SJI, the flagship of the Lasallian enterprise in Asia, was established in Singapore in 1852. The crown surmounting the crest symbolises victory – the victory of faith over the forces of evil. It is also a reminder that SJI was founded in the days when Singapore was still a British colony. At the bottom-right quadrant of the crest is the monogram of the school – ‘SJI’.
