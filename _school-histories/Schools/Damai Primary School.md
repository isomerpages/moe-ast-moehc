#### **School History**
Damai Primary School was established on Bedok Reservoir Road in January 1984. _Damai_ is Malay for ‘peace and harmony’. In Chinese, it means ‘to reach the goal and forge ahead’. In 2015, Damai Primary School merged with Bedok West Primary School.

In January 2018, Damai Primary School moved into a new school building equipped with the most up-to-date facilities. The new campus was built on the vision, ‘The school within a park and a park within the school’, which remains its inspiration and aspiration for the future. The school was accorded Learning for Life Programmes in team sports and aesthetics.

In 2019, Damai Primary merged with East Coast Primary and retained the name of Damai.
