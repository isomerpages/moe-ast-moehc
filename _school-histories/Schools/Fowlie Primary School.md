#### **School History**
Fowlie Primary School began as Fowlie School in 1956. It was located at Fowlie Road, which was named after Dr Peter Fowlie, who was Municipal Commissioner in 1912.

In 1986, Seraya Primary School merged with Fowlie School, and the name of the school was changed to Fowlie Primary School.

The school published a regular newsletter. It was originally named _Fowlink_, and later renamed _FPS News_.

In December 1998, Fowlie Primary occupied the premises of the former Tanjong Katong Girls’ School until its new school building was completed in 2000.

In 2000, Fowlie’s Angklung and Handbells Ensemble won the Silver award at the Singapore Youth Festival. In the same year, the school’s cricket team topped the National Under-13 Championship.

In January 2001, Fowlie Primary School merged with Haig Boys’ Primary School and Mountbatten Primary School to become Tanjong Katong Primary School.

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

At school we gather, each day with heart<br>
Both light and gay, fresh and smart<br>
In white and blue, ready to give our best<br>
Loyal and true with one heart and voice we sing<br>
And long may our echoes ring<br>
Of knowledge, courage and true endeavour<br>
And as we strive to achieve, to achieve<br>
As we strive ahead towards excellence.
