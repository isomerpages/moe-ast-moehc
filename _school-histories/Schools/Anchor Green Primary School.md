#### **School History**
Anchor Green Primary School was established in December 2007 to serve the growing number of young families in the new town of Sengkang. The school opened with an enrolment of 273 students in nine classes from Primary One to Primary Three. The school has also gradually expanded on its facilities, with an indoor sports hall added in 2011 and an annex block completed under the PERI upgrading project in 2018. Upon completion of the new block, Anchor Green Primary saw its first intake of Ministry of Education kindergarten pupils in 2019.  
  
The school developed environmental programmes that are in line with the school’s vision of building a community of aspiring and gracious learners, with a focus on applied learning programmes where every student can play their part to protect the environment.  This is achieved through the tiered approach where each level and specific group of pupils will focus on an environmental area to work on.  The school also partners with agencies such as the National Environment Agency, the Public Utilities Board and IKEA Singapore. In 2014, Anchor Green Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in Serve and Lead through Environment Education.  This LLP was subsequently converted to an Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 2019; Empowering Learners to be Environmental Activists (ELEA).

With the passing of the baton in 2015 to its second principal, Mdm Norliza, deeper collaboration was forged with the school’s corporate partners – IKEA Singapore and Brother International – to commemorate SG50 with a strong environmental theme in the celebrations. The school also saw the opening of Anchor Glade in 2016, a garden for students to enjoy and appreciate nature and greenery. The school was accorded the 2017 President’s Award for the Environment in recognition of the school’s continuous efforts in promoting environmental education and awareness among staff, students and the community. 
  
In 2016, Anchor Green Primary School was accorded a second Learning for Life Programme in Aspire, Grow Passion, Serve through the Arts (AGPS.Arts). The school’s vision from **A.G.P.S. Arts** is to develop every Anchorlite to be a Lifelong Learner and a Lifelong Advocate of the Arts by building upon our pupils' knowledge, skills and love for the arts, nurturing their creative expressions, enriching their social, cultural and heritage awareness and growing them to be confident, critical and creative learners and active contributors to society through a wide spectrum of arts platforms.

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Dhillon Awtar Singh (2007–2014)<br>
\- Mdm Norliza Bte A. Rahim (2014–present)

#### School Crest
<img src="/images/anchorgreenpri1.png" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school logo embodies an anchor encased by a blue arc on top and a green arc at the bottom. The anchor symbolizes stability and well-grounded hope.   
  
The ring of the anchor is illustrated as a child with outstretched arms which symbolises a balanced and holistic education. The two flukes represent family and school. As the flukes secure a vessel at sea, here at Anchor Green, the school and family forge a stable partnership, to bring out the best in every student and ground him in values.

The anchor is cocooned by 2 subtended arcs. The green arc at the bottom represents every Anchor Green student’s commitment to save and protect the environment. The blue arc on top represents Anchor Green student’s commitment to the global community. The entire logo tilted at an axis symbolizes creativity and innovation.

#### School Song
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Such noble history, and loyal humble pride.<br>
Where do all these things meet, within the oceans wide?

At Anchor Green! At Anchor Green!<br>
Where we aspire to grow and learn.<br>
At Anchor Green! At Anchor Green!<br>
The compass points to all we need.

For our Respect! Integrity!<br>
Confidence! Excellence!<br>
Where all our hopes and all our dreams,<br>
Fulfil at Anchor Green!
  
We’ll take these values when we leave,<br>
To serve the world outside.<br>
With love, respect and courage!<br>
We shall be our Nation’s pride.
  
(Chorus)
