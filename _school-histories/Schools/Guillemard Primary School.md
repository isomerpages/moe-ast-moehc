#### **School History**
Guillemard Primary School was formed in 1984 when Guillemard Road English School merged with Guillemard West Primary School. Established in 1954, Guillemard Road English School was located along Guillemard Road. Between 1954 and 1956, Guillemard Road English School functioned from the premises of other schools such as Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School, Haig Girls’ School, Paya Lebar English School and Siglap Secondary School. In 1956, the school shifted operations to its own school building at 23 Guillemard Crescent.  
  
In 1987, Guillemard Primary School closed down and its school building was subsequently demolished. The former site of Guillemard Primary School remained vacant until 2009. Since 2009, Guillemard Village shopping mall has taken over the site.

#### **School Song**
Guillemard Primary, this our school,<br>
We look on you with joy and pride;<br>
We think of you with hearts so full,<br>
That gave us knowledge rich and wide.

Her sons and daughters are we all,<br>
Her name and honour high uphold;<br>
Her banner never let it fall,<br>
Her praises sing to all the world.

To do our best in class and field,<br>
To add more glories to her name.<br>
“To strive, to fight and not to yield”<br>
But onward to success and fame.
