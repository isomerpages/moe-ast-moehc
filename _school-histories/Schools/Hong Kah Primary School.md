#### **School History**
As Bukit Batok became more populated, there was a need to start a new school to cater for the growing number of children. Hong Kah Primary School was established in 1995 and officially opened on 29 August 1997.

The school building attracted a lot of attention as it was one of the ‘designer’ schools in Singapore. Located at the end of Bukit Batok West Avenue 2 and facing a large forested area, the school building was unique, with a distinct identity. Many students and parents compared it to a resort or a condominium. The library block was designed to look like a rocket ready for take-off.

Hong Kah was well known for its sustained achievements in volleyball. Led by a team of dedicated teachers, within a short span of three years, the junior and senior boys team won the national championships in 2003. From 2003 to 2014, Hong Kah clinched 10 national and 15 zonal championships, achieving the Programme for School-based Excellence in 2008.

In 2015, Hong Kah Primary School merged with Lianhua Primary School and continued to operate under the latter’s name. Despite its relatively short history of 20 years, Hong Kah built a reputation where its guiding beacon was the culture of care. There was much that the school had done to provide students with an enriching learning experience; show them the wonders of the world, beyond just their home and school; and, more importantly, give them hope for the future.
