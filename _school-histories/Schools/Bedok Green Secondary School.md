#### **School History**
Bedok Green Secondary School opened its doors to students in 2001 at its holding school located at Bedok South Road. In the following year, the school moved to new premises at 360 Bedok Avenue 3. The flag was lowered for the last time at the holding school and everyone then walked with great excitement to the new school building. To mark the occasion, a bamboo plant from the holding school was planted at the new campus. The new building was officially opened in 2003.

Since 2001, Bedok Green Secondary’s teaching staff has grown from the original 14 to the current 112 in 2020 supported by 24 non- teaching staff. The school’s pupil enrolment has also increased from 400 in 2001 to 1056 in 2020.

In 2015, Bedok Green Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme called ‘ilnquire. iInnovate’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Building Character and Values through Performing Arts’.

#### **School Motto**
Believe and Grow

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bedokgreensec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest features two leafy bamboo stems within a diamond, with a gold band bearing the school motto, ‘Believe and Grow’. The bamboo signifies continuous growth even under adverse conditions, strength in unity, humility, uprightness and integrity. The diamond represents the product of what the school seeks to do. Like craftsmen who bring out the shine in rough diamonds, the school aims to bring out the best in every student, adding value and giving each student a brilliance that will last forever. Together, the bamboo and the diamond reflect the school’s focus on character development and on the fullest development of the individual’s potential.
