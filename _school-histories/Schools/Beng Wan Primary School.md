#### **School History**
Beng Wan Primary School began on 2 January 1977. It was officially declared open on 25 July 1978. On 21 January 1990, Beng Wan Primary School was the first school to offer Hindi classes. The Hindi Society (Singapore) was also registered in the same year. This was a historic occasion for the school and the Hindi-speaking population of Singapore, as this was the first time that Hindi teaching was organised on an island-wide basis.

In 1997, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary.

In 2004, Beng Wan Primary School merged with Bendemeer Primary School.

To Beng Wan we go willingly<br>
There we learn to grow up graciously<br>
With discipline and care<br>
We are taught to serve lovingly<br>
Our teachers and fellow friends and everyone there

Love we must truly<br>
Serve we must sincerely<br>
Our beloved Beng Wan<br>
As best as she can be<br>
May Beng Wan strive courageously<br>
May our pupils sow carefully<br>
With ruggedness we will grow<br>
And with graciousness we will glow<br>
As the best can only grow in a happy place.
