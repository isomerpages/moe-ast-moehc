#### **School History**
Established in 1953, Rayman School was located in the former Rayman Estate. The school operated with two&nbsp;sessions&nbsp;– the morning session was named Rayman School I and the afternoon session named Rayman School II. Each had a different Principal. In 1956, both schools came to be under one Principal and extra-curricular activities were combined. In 1956, the school had 1001 enrolled students.  
  
In 1984, Rayman School closed . Since then, the school’s single-storey building has housed the Handicaps Welfare Association.
