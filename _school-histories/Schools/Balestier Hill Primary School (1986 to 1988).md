#### **School History**
Balestier Hill Primary School was established in 1986 following the merger of Balestier Hill West Primary School and Balestier Hill East Primary School. The amalgamated school used the buildings of both of its former schools which were located next to each other along Balestier Road.  
  
Balestier Hill Primary School closed in 1988 and its pupils joined Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School in 1989.  
  
Note: A new Balestier Hill Primary Hill Primary school later opened at Balestier Hill in 2002. It merged with Bendemeer Primary School in 2019 and relocated to Bendemeer Road.
