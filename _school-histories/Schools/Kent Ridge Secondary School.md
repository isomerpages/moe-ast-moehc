#### **School History**
Kent Ridge Secondary School (KRSS) began operations at the former Yusof Ishak Secondary School at 27A Jubilee Road on 2 January 2000. The school relocated to its current premises at 147 West Coast Road in December 2001 and was officially opened on 15 March 2003.

Guided by the school philosophy, ‘Every Student Counts’, and the school values of fitness, integrity, respect and excellence, KRSS nurtures the heart, ignites passion and strengthens the will so that every student has the ‘Heart of a Saint, Passion of an Inventor and Will of an Olympian’.

Throughout the years, KRSS has provided a quality and holistic education for students. In 2006, the school held its first Combined Performing Arts Concert the Singapore Polytechnic Convention Centre. The event was renamed _Vivace!_ in 2014. Overseas service learning trips were introduced in 2008. The school places strong emphasis on character and values inculcation through explicit teaching and experiential learning platforms such as values-in-action projects. In addition, the school sets aside a day each year for the whole school to do their part for the community. This initiative, known as the KR Hands-On Day, was introduced in 2009.

In 2015, the school introduced its Learning for Life Programme in sports and outdoor education, known as ‘EVOKE!@KR’ (Educational Values of Olympism at Kent Ridge). This programme provides students with outdoor experiential learning opportunities, such as level-wide camps to develop their character and values as well as strengthen their people skills. In 2016, in line with Singapore’s initiative to build a Smart Nation and better prepare students for the future, the school introduced its Applied Learning Programme in the domain of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), known as ‘Developing Computational Thinking through Robotics’. It provides learning opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and skills in STEM to solve real-world problems.

In 2016, the school was awarded Best Practice for Student All-Round Development by the Ministry of Education. This affirms the school’s efforts in providing a quality and holistic education for students.

KRSS has grown from strength to strength and is today a well-established school in the West Coast area, known for its emphasis on a holistic education rooted in values and a culture of care and excellence.

#### **School Motto**
Beyond Frontiers

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/kentridgesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The Kent Ridge Secondary School logo consists of a torch with a banner bearing the school name, and the motto, ‘Beyond Frontiers’, placed below it. The central image of the torch symbolises the will and drive of an Olympian. The shining yellow flames forming the letters ‘K’ and ‘R’ – the school’s initials – reflect passion, enthusiasm and perseverance. The blue ring bearing the school motto ties the graphical elements together, producing unity and cohesiveness – the desired qualities of the school.

The colour blue represents the character and stability of the students and institution, while the white interior reflects purity of thought. The stately grey banner with the school name complements the two dominant colours of yellow and blue, projecting prestige and honour.

Kent Ridgeans we will strive and move beyond frontiers<br>
Excelling in all our endeavours<br>
Never holding back<br>
Always enterprising to be the best that we can be<br>
Resilient and determined to overcome setbacks<br>
Improving and achieving greater heights<br>
Dare to make a difference<br>
Giving our best<br>
Earnestly in our lives<br>
Searching for knowledge in our daily quest<br>
Embracing our values too<br>
Caring for others moulding heart and mind<br>
Seek to do it right the first time<br>
Come let us spread our gleams of light<br>
Hand in hand we can create a better life<br>
Our hopes and our dreams only can come true<br>
Living the Kent Ridgean life
