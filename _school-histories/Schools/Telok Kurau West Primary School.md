#### **School History**
Established in 1962, Telok Kurau West Primary school was located at Telok Kurau Road. The school was located next to Telok Kurau East Primary School and Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School.  
  
In 1983, Telok Kurau West School merged with Telok Kurau Malay Girls' School. In 1985, this amalgamated school merged with Telok Kurau East School to form Telok Kurau Primary School. In 2001, Telok Kurau Primary School merged with Bedok Town Primary School, while retaining the name of the former.
