#### **School History**
Queenstown Secondary School was founded in 1956 as Queenstown Secondary Technical School, an all-boys technical school. It operated from the premises of Jalan Eunos School. In January 1957, the school moved to its current premises at Strathmore Avenue.

In 1965, the school began offering pre-university classes to meet the educational needs and this lasted for 29 years until 1994. Queenstown Secondary produced its first Yang Di-Pertuan Negara Scholarship recipient (now known as the President Scholarship), Mr Ang Hock Chye. In 1966, Mr Lee Yock Suan became the second Queenstownian to be awarded the President’s Scholarship.  He was later appointed a minister and served in several ministries from 1983 to 2004.

In 1971, the school became co-educational. Keeping up with the times, the school was renamed as Queenstown Secondary School in 1993. In December that year, the school moved to a temporary site at 369 Commonwealth Avenue, and returned to its current premises at Strathmore Avenue in June 1997. It became single-session. The new school building and the QUEST Museum were officially opened on 9 July 1999.

In 2013, the school officially established a satellite partnership with the Lee Kong Chian Gardens School (MINDS). In 2015, it achieved its first Gold Award for the National Youth Achievement Award.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in humanities and science, titled ‘Minds for the Future – First Cultivating the Disciplined and Synthesising Mind’. In the following year, it was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in community and youth leadership.

Queenstown Secondary School celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016.

#### **School Motto**
Berani Berkhidmat – Dare to Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/queenstownsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest features a shield with the school colours, sky blue and maroon. The sky blue colour reflects the limitless opportunities to strive for, and maroon signifies the spirit of fraternity. The open book symbolises learning and knowledge, and the wheel symbolises the importance of technical education, which the school offered in its earlier years.

On the tower, which denotes strength, is a lion, which signifies courage and from which Singapore derives its name. Below the shield is a banner bearing the school motto, ‘Berani Berkhidmat’, which is Malay for ‘Dare to Serve’. It signals the time when a young, independent Singapore required men and women of courage to serve the nation. The school is confident that all Queenstownians will continue to overcome the challenges that lie ahead.

#### **School Song**

In Queenstown Secondary our minds are trained<br>
Our hands acquire the skill<br>
Whatever the task we’re here to serve<br>
We have the heart, the will<br>
Queenstown Secondary the pioneer<br>
The school that leads the way<br>
In every field we do our best<br>
To learn, to work, to play

Chorus<br>
Berani Berkhidmat, dare to serve<br>
Dare to do to be!<br>
Dare to serve – yes! with our hearts<br>
To keep our country free<br>
Berani Berkhidmat, dare to serve<br>
Dare to do to be!<br>
We dare to serve – yes! with our hearts<br>
To keep our country free
