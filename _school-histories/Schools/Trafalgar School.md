#### **School History**
Trafalgar School was a co-ed school established before the 1950s by the British. The school was housed in a one-story building that overlooked the sea at South Quay.

Trafalgar School closed &nbsp;in the early 1980s to make way for the Tanjong Pagar container terminal. The sea that stood in front of the school is now reclaimed land.  
  
Principals:<br>
\- Mr Lim Lam San (1955-1958)
