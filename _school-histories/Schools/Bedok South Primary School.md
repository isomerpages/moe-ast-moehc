#### **School History**
Bedok South Primary School was located at Bedok South Avenue 2. It was officially declared open on 15 April 1981.

In 1985, the Reading for English Acquisition Programme (REAP) was introduced in the school’s primary one classes. The programmme taught students the conventions of print and high frequency words and aimed to build their oral foundation.

Bedok South Primary School also actively fostered ties with Bedok South Secondary School. Bedok South Primary’s student leaders participated in leadership training camps organised by the secondary school. Students from both schools together participated in camping activities. The students from the secondary school also conducted peer group tuition lessons for the Primary Six students at Bedok South Primary School.

In January 2002, it merged with Bedok View Primary School to become Bedok Green Primary School.
