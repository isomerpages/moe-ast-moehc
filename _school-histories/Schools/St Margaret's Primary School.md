#### **School History**
The history of St Margaret’s School, the oldest school in Singapore and Southeast Asia, dates back to 1842. Mrs Maria Dyer, a young missionary of the London Missionary Society, started the school in the spirit of ‘charity, patience and devotion’ – the school’s motto today. Also known as Chinese Girls’ School, it was located in a shophouse on North Bridge Road. The girls were taught the Christian faith, given an elementary education and, above all, taught to be good homemakers. With special emphasis on character building and leadership, the education trained the girls to be independent. This has been the school’s tradition since then.

In 1861, the school relocated from North Bridge Road to 134 Sophia Road. In 1900, the school was renamed ‘CEZMS (Church of England Zenana Missionary Society) School’. In 1939, the school was accorded grant-in-aid status, and it became a day school for girls of all races. In 1949, Bishop Wilson renamed the school ‘St Margaret’s School’, in honour of Queen Margaret of Scotland.

The late 1940s saw domestic science become part of the school curriculum, a netball team formed and a Girl Guide Company incorporated. In 1960, the school was split into primary and secondary sections. The secondary school moved to Farrer Road. The familiar old building at 134 Sophia Road, which continued to house the primary school was finally demolished in August 1984. While awaiting the completion of the new building, the primary school relocated to a holding site on Anthony Road. It returned to the old site in June 1986, with a new address – 99 Wilkie Road. The new building was officially opened on St Margaret’s Day, 16 November 1987.

On 16 November 1997, the National Heritage Board recognised the school’s long history in Singapore by marking the school’s Wilkie Road premises as a national historic site. In 1999, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, which was completed in 2001.

With its record of helpfulness, good work and dedicated service, the school is well loved by all who have passed through its gates and will be loved and honoured by those yet to come. This is heritage of St Margaret’s School – a girls’ school with a tradition of service to neighbours, the community and the nation.

#### **School Motto**
Charity, Patience, Devotion

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/stmargaretpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The green background represents creation – life and activity, creativity and growth. The white cross represents the Christian mission of the school. Like a directional compass, it shows the right way to take and points the school to God’s love, truth and provision. The white band running diagonally across from the upper left hand corner to the lower corner stands for purity in thought, word and deed. The sash at the base of the emblem represents the friendship ties that bind all who are in the St Margaret’s School family

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

In these sound walls a goodly learning frame,<br>
Who here abide true kindliness impart<br>
With steadfast love, devotion firm inflame<br>
The fire that waits in every heart

For Charity, Patience, Devotion let's be known.<br>
These qualities St Margaret's shown,<br>
On which our school has grown.

We learn to serve our God, our State, our School<br>
In service free for neighbour, home and friend,<br>
So may we keep the all embracing rule<br>
In care for all our lives to spend.

When life brings pain, when trials us defy<br>
Our faith, our hope, our discipline require<br>
Us to withstand, respond with spirit high,<br>
St Margaret, shall again inspire.
