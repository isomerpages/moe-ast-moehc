#### **School History**
Tanjong Katong Primary School (TKP) was established in 2001 with an enrolment of 1,700 students as a result of an amalgamation of three schools: Fowlie Primary, Haig Boys’ and Mountbatten Primary.

Three years after the school began operations, it held its official opening ceremony on 15 July 2004. This took the form of a musical entitled&nbsp;_Winds of Change_, held at Victoria Theatre. It depicted the transition from the three schools to the new TKP.

In its early days, the school had a reputation of being a ‘mini United Nations’. In 2007, about 400 of its 1,700 students came from more than 30 countries. Till today, the school continues to boast of a diverse student population with students from different cultures and backgrounds. In 2010, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary by staging a musical called&nbsp;_Upgrade_. A new school song was launched during the celebrations.

The school has sports classes from Primary Five to Six known as Olympism classes, which were started to nurture students in its niche sports co-curricular activities: netball, floorball, football and hockey. In 2015, the school repositioned its Programme for School Excellence to a Learning for Life Programme called ‘Team Sports Excellence@TKP’ to promote students’ active participation in sports and to develop teamwork as an important life skill.

In 2016, TKP celebrated its 15th anniversary with the launch of the TKP Heritage Gallery. The heritage gallery features the brief history of Katong, where the school is situated, and the history of the ancestral schools as well as the history of TKP. Together with the Katong interactive trails designed by the students in conjunction with SG50, they form the school’s heritage programme, which has been integrated into the Social Studies curriculum.

As part of its efforts to reach out to former students, the school’s inaugural homecoming event was organised in end 2017. The school relocated to a holding site on New Upper Changi Road&nbsp; while its original premises were renovated due to PERI upgrading.

In school, we read and count and draw<br>
and sing and run and play.<br>
We're leaders with big hearts<br>
and we live our best each day.

Honest in our word and deed respecting all, big and small.<br>
We stand for what is right and lift up<br>
those who fall.

Creative in our thinking we look at things,<br>
from all ways.<br>
Happy, healthy children<br>
As TK is our place!

Disciplined to see things through<br>
we think before we act.

With confidence and eloquence<br>
we'll be a great impact.

We love to learn<br>
We do our best<br>
With strength for all life's test.<br>
We love to learn<br>
We do our best

We're one big family.
