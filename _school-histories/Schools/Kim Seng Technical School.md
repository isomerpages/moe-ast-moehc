#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>	

Onward, forward we go,<br>
Kindred spirit we must show<br>
Guided not by values false<br>
Together we go where duty calls.

_Chorus_<br>
Enter we learn depart we serve,<br>
Glory we bring to our school<br>
Seeking to learn departing to serve<br>
Glory to the school we love

Onward, forward we go,<br>
Kindred spirit we must show<br>
Steadfastly we all should strive<br>
To make a success of our lives.
