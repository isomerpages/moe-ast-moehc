#### **School History**
Red Swastika School was founded in 1951 as Wan Tzu School by the World Red Swastika Society (Singapore Administration Centre), a religious and charitable organisation. The piece of land at Somapah Road in Changi was donated by the society’s then president, Mr Quek Shin, who saw the need to provide free primary education for the poor and to aid in the promotion of education in the outlying areas. On 13 January 1951, the foundation stone was laid at the school opening ceremony. In 1956, Wan Tzu School was renamed Red Swastika School. In 1979, the pre-primary programme was introduced. In 1981, the school relocated to its present premises at Bedok North Avenue 3.

In 1987, the school was selected as one of the six primary schools to pilot the use of both Chinese and English as the main media of instruction. In 1990, Red Swastika School was one of the 15 primary schools accorded the Special Assistance Plan as a recognition for its strength in providing a holistic and enriched experience in Chinese language learning and cultural appreciation. In 2005, the school completed PRIME upgrading. In 2016, the school celebrated its 65th anniversary. In 2018, the school underwent PERI upgrading.

In 2014, Red Swastika School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Every RSS Student A Leader’. In 2018, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Tinkers to Thinkers’.

The gears of wheels of history symbolise progressiveness. The swastika sign symbolises prosperity and good luck. The two torches represent light and life.
