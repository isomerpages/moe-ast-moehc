#### **School History**
Established in 1932, Meng Teck School was located at Jalan Seranggong Kechil, off Punggol Road.  
  
In 1985, Meng Teck School closed and its remaining students were transferred to Holy Innocents’ Primary School. Meng Teck School’s building was converted into a church centre for several years. Subsequently, the former site of the school was occupied by CHIJ St. Joseph’s Convent, which has remained there since then.
