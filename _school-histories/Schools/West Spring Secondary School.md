#### **School History**
West Spring Secondary School was established in 2001, sharing premises with Zhenghua Secondary School. It subsequently moved to a holding site in Teck Whye Estate. In 2005, West Spring Secondary School was relocated to its current premises at 61 Senja Road. The school was officially declared open on 9 September 2005.

West Spring Secondary School quickly established itself as a school known for innovative academic and co-curricular programmes that enhance students’ learning experiences.

In 2008, the school raised $10,000 in support of the President’s Challenge. In the following year, the school welcomed the Asian Youth Games with the torch relay passing through the school premises. West Spring Secondary School celebrated its first decade of founding in 2010 with a concert. In that same year, it gained niche status in shooting.

In 2013, West Spring Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in media literacy. The programme aims to develop effective communication skills and for students to discern the right values-based choices in information acquired and created. The school was also accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘FOCUS’ (Finding, Optimising, Communicating, Understanding Sports). It seeks to provide students with a strong foundation in the learning, participation and enjoyment of a wide variety of physical activities and sports.

In 2015, West Spring Secondary School celebrated its 15th anniversary with a concert, showing the diverse talents of its performing arts groups. The school continues to be firmly built upon character and academic excellence, and seeks to innovate and develop the joy of learning among students.

The letter ‘W’ is stylised as a a waterfall, signifying a neverending flow of knowledge from the book. It is also a fountain that sends knowledge from the students up to the book. This represents a neverending thirst for knowledge. The red triple ‘S’ symbolises the flames of passion for learning, surviving and excelling.
