#### **School History**
West View Primary School began operations on 2 January 1998, housed in the former Jalan Teck Whye Primary School and Bukit Panjang Malay School with very limited facilities. In December 1999, the school moved to its current premises at 31 Senja Road.

Past signature programmes included Elective Modules Programme, Independent Learners in Action, and Success through Engaging Problem Solving. All these programmes were designed to equip students with knowledge and skills that would instill an innovative and creative mindset. The school achieved a niche in innovation, and won recognition and accolades in the Young Entrepreneurs’ Skills Competition as well as the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors’ Award.

In 2015, the school underwent PERI upgrading. The enhanced infrastructure has provided its students with a vibrant and conducive learning environment that better supports their holistic development. In 2016, the school started operating in a single-session, and the student population has stabilised to its current 899 students in 30 classes.

In 2016, STRIVE@WVPS&nbsp;was started as the school’s signature programme to enrich its students’ learning beyond the confines of the classrooms and academic subjects. Students go through a range of modular activities to arouse their curiosity, developing in them the ability to deal with ambiguity and having the willingness to try their hand at something new. ACE the Arts, another signature programme, was endorsed as its Learning for Life Programme in 2017. Through this comprehensive six-year programme, students are given ample exposure and experience to appreciate the arts and discover their talents, to develop their character, attitudes and values.

In 2018, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme on environmental science. Known as FRIEND of Earth, the&nbsp;programme serves to empower students with the knowledge, values and dispositions to make environmentally friendly decisions to promote a more sustainable living for the future.&nbsp;

\- Mr N. Jayachandran (1998–2006)<br>
\- Mdm Rashidah Abdul Rasip (2007–2014)<br>
\- Mr Eddie Foo (2015–present)

#### **School Motto**
Aim High

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/westviewpri1.png">

The school crest shows three closely growing flowering plants enclosed in a pentagon. The light blue background signifies the purity and innocence of children. The flowering plants forming the letters ‘W’ and ‘V’ represent the zest, exuberance and growth that students experience while in school, and the closeness of the plants indicates the friendship and trust among students, teachers and the school community. The five sides of the pentagon symbolise the continuous development of the children – morally, cognitively, physically, socially and aesthetically.
