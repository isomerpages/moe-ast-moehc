#### **School History**
Pearl’s Hill School was established in 1881 at Cross Street. Formerly known as the Singapore Chinese Branch School, Pearl’s Hill Primary School was among the pioneer batch of Government Schools set up by the colonial government. The school served as a feeder school for Raffles Institution. By 1885, the school had become known as Cross Street School.&nbsp;

In 1906, it was converted into a preparatory school and was affiliated with Outram Road School. With this development, the school was renamed Cross Street Infants’ School.&nbsp;

In 1914, Cross Street Infants’ School was closed and replaced with a new school on Pearl’s Hill Road known as Pearl’s Hill School.&nbsp;

In 1972, Pearl’s Hill School shifted to a new site at Chin Swee Road. This school building was known for being 12 storeys high, which made it the tallest school building in Singapore at that time.&nbsp;

In 1995, Pearl’s Hill School merged with Pearl Park Primary School, retaining the name of the former.&nbsp;&nbsp;

On 31 December 2001, Pearl’s Hill School closed and the former building of the school at Chin Swee Road has since housed Hotel Re!.&nbsp;
