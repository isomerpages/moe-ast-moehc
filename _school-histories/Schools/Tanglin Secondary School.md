#### **School History**
Tanglin Secondary School was established in 1964 as Tanglin Integrated Secondary Technical School, located in Queenstown. The school was officially declared open on 16 October 1964. The school was Singapore’s first technical school where the medium of instruction was in Chinese. It was also the first school in Singapore to admit female students to technical courses.

In 1969, Tanglin Integrated Secondary Technical School was renamed as Tanglin Technical Secondary School. The school celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1989.  In 1993, the school moved to its current premises at 301 West Coast Road and was renamed as Tanglin Secondary School. In 2014, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary.

In 2015, Tanglin Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Tanglin PLUS’ (Perspectives and Literacies to Understand Society). Through this programme, students acquire deeper and broader knowledge to investigate societal issues. To make learning relevant, students are given opportunities to apply their knowledge to real-world situations, requiring them to use critical thinking and effective communication skills. Partners, such as the Singapore Botanic Gardens, National Gallery Singapore and Boeing, have been engaged to provide authentic learning experiences for the students.

In 2016, Tanglin Secondary School merged with Clementi Woods Secondary School. The school vision was updated to ‘Leaders of the Future, Pride of the Community’. In the same year, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in the arts, where students are introduced to the three domains of arts education: visual art, music and dance. Through the programme, students gain sensitivity and a sense of appreciation towards the arts. As they are given multiple opportunities to perform for the community, students are also able to further develop their talents.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/tanglinsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The badge was redesigned at the end of 2015 to mark Tanglin Secondary School’s rebirth as a merged school with Clementi Woods Secondary School.

<br clear="left">

The pentagon symbolises the five main aspects of education: intellectual, cultural, moral, physical and aesthetics. The arc represents the all-round holistic education that Tanglin Secondary School offers. The yellow lines radiating from the bottom-left corner of the pentagon represent the rays of the sun. They are a reminder that all students start as equals when they enter the school but eventually graduate and shine as unique individuals with their own skill sets. This ties in with the school’s philosophy, ‘Everyone is Unique; All can Succeed’. Each ray represents the school’s heritage from the former schools that merged to form the current Tanglin Secondary: Ghim Moh Secondary School, Jin Tai Secondary School, Clementi Woods Secondary School and Tanglin Secondary School.

The rays spread diagonally upwards, signifying the school’s constant growth and success while being firmly rooted in traditions and beginnings. When the rays branch out through the arc, they represent the school pushing beyond boundaries to develop students with the strength and character to shape a nation of the future.
