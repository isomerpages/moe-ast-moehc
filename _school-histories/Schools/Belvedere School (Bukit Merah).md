#### **School History**
Belvedere School was established in 1957. In 1988, Xianglin Primary School and Belvedere School amalgamated to form a new Belvedere Primary School. This new Belvedere Primary School was housed in the Xianglin Primary School building at 370 Tanglin Road.

Over time, the enrolment in Belvedere Primary School gradually declined due to population shifts in the neighbourhood estate and the school closed in December 1990.

#### **School Song**
Voices united loud and clear<br>
Sing in praise of Belvedere!<br>
This second home that we daily meet<br>
To learn and play and to succeed

Chorus:<br>
Obedience, honor<br>
Respect and loyalty<br>
We will we will<br>
Forever pledge

When each other no longer meet<br>
When our teachers we do not greet<br>
Memories of our great years here<br>
We will sing for Belvedere
  
Chorus (Repeat)
