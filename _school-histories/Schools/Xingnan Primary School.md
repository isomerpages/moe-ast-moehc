#### **School History**
Xingnan Primary School was established in 1932 as a Chinese-medium public school with only 10 students. Then known as Sin Nan Public School (公立醒南学校), it was housed in a Chinese temple (环图宫玉皇上帝庙) along Hong Kah Road. Due to an expanding student population, the school shifted to a site at 776 Old Jurong Road in 1939. It remained there until 1986.

During the Japanese Occupation, the school was forced to close. After the Second World War, with strong support from the village community leaders and the School Management Committee, the school reopened its doors and expanded its physical facilities as student enrolment rose rapidly. In 1953, the school raised funds to replace the attap roofs with zinc roofs. In 1982, Xingnan Primary School became an English-medium, government-aided school and took in its first batch of Malay pupils. The school relocated to its present site at 5 Jurong West Street 91 in end 1986 and became a full government school two years later.

The principal then, Mr Lee Chee Hian, rallied community support to petition the government to prevent the school name being changed due to the relocation. Hence, while retaining its name in Chinese characters, the school’s English name was changed to the present Xingnan Primary School. In 1989, the school was officially declared open.

In 2006, the school set up a heritage museum as part of its 75th anniversary celebrations. The school had undergone PRIME in 1999, and completed PERI upgrading with new facilities such as an indoor sports hall, special rooms and a fitness playground in 2014.

Over the years, Xingnan Primary School has built on its long history and rich heritage to provide opportunities for holistic development and lifelong learning.

#### **School Motto**
For Country and For School (卫国为校)

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/xingnanpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest was designed by Ms Peng Huijun, a former student, in 1988. It was designed to link Xingnan’s past with the future. The four red petals symbolise the four official languages taught in the school. The torch is the symbol of the old school, signifying knowledge and enlightenment. The diamond outline, which resembles a mortar board, kindles in the young mind the thought of tertiary education. In 2006, to reflect the change in the primary education system from an eight-year course to a six-year course, the crest was redesigned to include six bands, each indicating a year of study in primary school. The phrase, “Established 1932”, was also included to remind all students of the school’s history and how far it has come.

Once a little village school it was<br>
But today an ultra modern school<br>
And we have the best facilities<br>

In our studies and the CCAs<br>
To be useful loyal citizens<br>
And to love our Singapore

We are proud of Xingnan Primary School<br>
And we’re proud of our teachers too<br>
We’ll hold our heads up high<br>
For country and for school
