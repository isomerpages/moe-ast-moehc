#### **School History**
The history of Fengshan Primary School dates back to 1933. It was then an old-style _kampong_ (village) school. It ceased operations during the Japanese Occupation, and reopened in 1945 after the war. The school became known as Hong San Primary School as it received funds from the Hong San Temple Association. It was restarted in Lorong Tai Seng to meet the educational needs of the children who had lost years of schooling as a result of the war.

Hong San Primary was a popular Chinese school in the 1960s, and the school’s founders stayed true to the cause of providing a good education throughout the challenging years. In 1982, a new school building was constructed at Bedok North Road. In 1999, enhancement to the school building was completed for the new Fengshan Primary.

In January 2001, Ping Yi Primary merged with Fengshan Primary to form the present Fengshan Primary School.  The name of Fengshan Primary was retained for historical reasons. On 2 February 2002, Fengshan Primary School was officially opened. A new leadership took on the challenge of bringing the two schools together to form the new Fengshan family of nearly 2,500 pupils in 66 classes with about 95 teaching staff. To form a unified identity, the ‘Fengshan Heartbeat’ was crafted to exemplify the school’s vision of ‘Anchored Hearts, Driven Minds, Leaders of Tomorrow’.

Fengshan Primary School ‘s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Anchored and Driven Leaders through Sports Excellence’, provides a common ground for students of different backgrounds to learn and excel in more than one sport, while developing the social and emotional competencies of students.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/fengshanpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The strokes form the letters “F”, “P” and “S” – the initials of Fengshan Primary School.

The fiery fluidity of the strokes represents diversity in the expression of talents, and the school’s celebration of achievements.

The maroon colour captures the passion and dynamism of the students, as well as a caring community spirit, reflective of the Fengshan heartbeat.

The movement evident in the upward strokes portray the strive for lifelong learning. Dual strokes represent unity and teamwork – the school and community working together with mutual trust and collaboration.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Where I am, I shine forth;<br>
Lend a hand, spare a thought,<br>
I make a difference.<br>
Where we go, we are known;<br>
Greater than the sum of our parts,<br>
Core values makes us one.<br>
Fengshan’s where we discover<br>
That learning’s never done,<br>
That passion is a virtue,<br>
And two is greater than one.<br>
Through our aspirations,<br>
All others, too, will see;<br>
Years later, still<br>
The Fengshan heartbeat beats in me!
