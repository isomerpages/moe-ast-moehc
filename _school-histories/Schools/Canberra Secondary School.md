#### **School History**
Canberra Secondary School is a government co-educational school established in 2000. It began operations in the present-day Sembawang Secondary School before moving to its current premises at 51 Sembawang Drive.

In 2012, Canberra Secondary School was awarded the niche programme status in digital media, in recognition of the school’s significant achievements in that area. In 2015, the school introduced its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Digital Media in Visual Arts and Design’, and its Learning for Life Programme, which focuses on community leadership. In the same year, Canberra Secondary celebrated its 15th anniversary. The celebrations culminated in&nbsp;_Canberran Nights_&nbsp;– a musical performance put up by the school’s staff and students.

Cultivating strong character in students has always been a priority for Canberra Secondary School. In recognition of this central role to mentor and guide students in character development, all teachers in 2018 were designated Character Coaches. The Student-Teacher Interaction Time is a key platform for Character Coaches to understand students’ backgrounds, aspirations and needs, in order to better guide them to achieve their goals.
