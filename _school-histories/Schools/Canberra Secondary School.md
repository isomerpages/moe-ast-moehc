#### **School History**
Canberra Secondary School is a government co-educational school established in 2000. It began operations in the present-day Sembawang Secondary School before moving to its current premises at 51 Sembawang Drive.

In 2012, Canberra Secondary School was awarded the niche programme status in digital media, in recognition of the school’s significant achievements in that area. In 2015, the school introduced its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Digital Media in Visual Arts and Design’, and its Learning for Life Programme, which focuses on community leadership. In the same year, Canberra Secondary celebrated its 15th anniversary. The celebrations culminated in _Canberran Nights_ – a musical performance put up by the school’s staff and students.

Cultivating strong character in students has always been a priority for Canberra Secondary School. In recognition of this central role to mentor and guide students in character development, all teachers in 2018 were designated Character Coaches. The Student-Teacher Interaction Time is a key platform for Character Coaches to understand students’ backgrounds, aspirations and needs, in order to better guide them to achieve their goals.

The school crest consists of the three C’s in the school motto: Challenge, Conquer and Contribute. The lowercase letter ‘i’ stands for information technology and innovation. The student, represented by the red dot, is going through different paths (the three C’s) to reach global achievement, as symbolised by the green dot.

A new day brings us faith to face the challenge.<br>
Let the seeds of knowledge set our minds aglow.<br>
A new day brings us strength to persevere.<br>
Let the will to give show our hearts of gold.<br>
We will challenge, conquer and contribute.<br>
With our thoughts and actions we will reach our goals.<br>
The hopes and future are in our hands.<br>
We will never stop aspiring, never stop believing.<br>
For we take pride in Canberra Secondary School
