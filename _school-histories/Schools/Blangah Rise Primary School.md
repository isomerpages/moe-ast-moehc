#### **School History**
Blangah Rise Primary School was established in 1977 as a Government School.  
  
In 1999, as the estate matured, 284 students from the former Jagoh Primary School joined the school. In December 1999, Blangah Rise Primary School relocated to its current premises in Telok Blangah Heights. In 2000, the school began operating as a single-session school.

In 2012, the school Indoor Sports Hall (ISH) was completed. In 2013, the Student Care Centre (SCC) was set up and began operations in the school. The Ministry of Education kindergarten, MK@Blangah Rise, was also set up in the school premises in 2014. In 2018, MK@Blangah Rise became part of the primary school.

Throughout the years, the school has launched various programmes to enhance student learning and well-being. These programmes include: Launched in 2003, the Ecology Board Game which attracted much publicity and accolades; launched in 2004, the Calorie Café which was a novel and unique way to raise physical fitness of the students. In 2015, the school launched two versions of a nature & heritage trail, The Green Snapshots. There is an app version of the trail which enhances students' learning, and also a guided tour version for the public led by student-docents. Also in 2015, Young Photographers, a platform for students to share and celebrate their photography works, was launched. In 2017, the school started the SATS School Meal Programme, a future-ready food solution that provides students with healthy and nutritious meals. In 2018, three major programmes were launched: the Learning from Life Programme (LLP) for community service and student leadership anchoring on environmental education, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) entitled Aspiring Confident Engineers (ACE) @ BRPS which anchors on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Education, and Stephen Covey’s Seven Habits for personal and interpersonal effectiveness. More recently in 2019, the school started the Accelerated Programme to Enhance students’ eXperience (APEX) to stretch the academic potential of students and nurture leadership skills. The Junior Reporters programme was also implemented to provide a platform for students to hone their Chinese Language skills by using the language in an authentic setting.
