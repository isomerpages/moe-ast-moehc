#### **School History**
Chong De Primary School was established in 1981. Between 1981 and 1982, Chong De Primary School students had lessons at neighbouring Ang Mo Kio North Primary and then at Chong Shan Primary School before moving to their own building.  
  
In 1998, Chong De Primary School closed and its remaining students subsequently joined Chong Shan Primary School. In 2001, Chong Shan Primary School merged with Townsville Primary School. Since then, Townsville Primary School has occupied the former site of Chong De Primary.

And this we are prepared to do.

Prepare ourselves from day to day.

For a better tomorrow, a better tomorrow,<br>
For a better tomorrow, a better tomorrow,<br>
