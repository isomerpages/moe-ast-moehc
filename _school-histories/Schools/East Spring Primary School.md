#### **School History**
East Spring Primary School was established in 1999 as a government school in the eastern part of Tampines New Town. In March 1999, the school moved to its current premises at Tampines Street 33. In 2003, East Spring Primary School hosted the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Science, known as Science Exploria. In 2006, the school was selected as one of the 10 schools to be in the pilot Flexible Infrastructure Scheme. Through this scheme, the school redefined its learning areas to include spaces beyond the four walls of the classroom. The school went single-session in 2012 to provide teachers with additional time and space to deliver a more holistic curriculum. It completed its PERI upgrading in 2014 with the inclusion of new facilities such as a dance studio, a teaching lab, an indoor sports hall and a student care centre. The School Heritage Wall, the SPRING Corridor and various interactive learning corners have also been created to strengthen the school’s emphasis on learning beyond the classroom.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), known as **Spring For Life (SFL)**, is part of the school’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme since 2014 to imbue values and build character through a progressive four-year outdoor education programme.  Revamped in 2020, it aims to provide E’Lights with an authentic experiential approach to learning the important OE components of Navigation, Climbing and Water Confidence through outdoor education. The LLP aims to develop E’Lights to be resilient and recover from challenges and failures, and leap forward to peaks of excellence.

The school started its Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 2019, to prepare E’Lights to learn and navigate responsibly in the digitalised knowledge society.  Other than coding, E’Lights also learn productivity and collaborative tools as well as cyberwellness values while apply their learning from Design Thinking to the real world context.   In line with the 21CC outcomes, the school hopes to nurture and guide every E’Light to be a confident communicator and a knowledge creator, as well as one who will actively contribute and collaborate with others for the betterment of the community.
