#### **School History**
Established in 1946, Nan Chiow Public School was located at 59, Lorong 23, Geylang. It started out in an attap house in Geylang Lorong 27, with around 90 students and three teachers. The students shared two classrooms.  
  
In 1948, the school moved to a bigger location in Lorong 27. By then, the student population has increased to over 200, and they had eight teachers. In 1950, the school moved back to Lorong 23, and had four classrooms and a staff office. There were 300 students then and ten teachers.  
  
In 1957, the school managed to get some funding and renovated the school building, adding two classrooms and a table tennis room.  
  
When the owner of the school building wanted to sell it in 1966, the School Board gathered donations to buy over the building. The collected funds were also used to give the school compound a major renovation.  
  
The school gained recognition for accomplishments in inter-school _Ping Pong_ competitions.

In 1981, the school closed due to low enrolment.
