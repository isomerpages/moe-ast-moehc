#### **School History**

In 2002, Queenstown Primary School merged with Mei Chin Primary School and Tanglin Primary School, with the resultant school named Queenstown Primary School.

#### **School Motto**

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/queenstownpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest comprises three jewels on a crown. It symbolises the fresh new dynamism of Queenstown Primary School. The three jewels represent the three primary schools – Mei Chin, Queenstown and Tanglin – that merged to form the crown, Queenstown Primary School.

The school colours are blue, green and red. Blue signifies peace and tranquillity in the school. Green signifies growing of young minds and developing their capabilities and competencies. Red signifies their passion for learning and the love they have for the nation.

The initials ‘QtPS’ represent the school’s three aspirations: quest for knowledge, progress, and strength of character.
