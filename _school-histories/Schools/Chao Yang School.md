The school ceased operations in 1981 due to declining enrolment. 
  
After Chao Yang School was closed, its building was used as Chao Yang Special School by The Association for Educationally Subnormal Children (now known as Association for Persons with Special Needs). In 1986, Chao Yang Special School moved to Ang Mo Kio
