#### **School History**
Alexandra Hill Primary School, also known as Alexandra Hill Integrated Primary School, was officially declared open on 11 September 1963.

In January 1987, Alexandra Hill Primary School introduced the Reading and English Acquisition Programme (REAP) to integrate the listening, speaking, reading and writing aspects of language learning for primary one to three students. The aim was to train students to become independent readers, fluent speakers and creative writers. The school also incorporated the Active Communication (ACT) programme in the primary four and six classes to improve the quality of language teaching and learning.

In June 1995, Alexandra Hill Primary School was one of six pilot schools to introduce the Accelerating the Use of Information Technology in Primary Schools (AITP) project.

The school published a regular newsletter, initially entitled _Alexstar_. After 1996, the newsletter was called _Alexandra Hill Newsletter_.

In 1997, Alexandra Hill Primary School absorbed students from Bukit Merah Primary School. In January 1998, the school moved to the former Bukit Merah Primary School premises at 100 Redhill Close. In 2000, the school was relocated to a temporary school building at 1 Telok Blangah Rise while its building was being renovated.

In January 2002, the school merged with Bukit Ho Swee Primary School, Henderson Primary School and Keng Seng Primary School to become Gan Eng Seng Primary School.
