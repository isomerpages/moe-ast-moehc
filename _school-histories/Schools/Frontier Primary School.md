#### **School History**
Frontier Primary School was established in 2011. Officially declared open in 2014, the school is currently located at 20 Jurong West Street 61.

Since its early years, Frontier Primary has regularly engaged parents on their hopes and aspirations for their children. The school has articulated this in its vision, mission and values, while including inputs from internal and external scans in the conceptualisation and design of its learning experiences.

As a young school with a pioneering spirit, Frontier Primary has made several bold efforts to actualise its philosophy of ‘Strong Fundamentals for Future Learning’. For example, it implemented its student leadership programme, exemplary Leaders @ Frontier, in 2012, when its only students were in Primary One. Its Chinese Dance and DanzWhiz groups also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival when its only members were in the lower primary. Frontier Primary was also one of the first primary schools to have implemented both a Learning for Life Programme and Applied Learning Programme – all within its first five years. It was the first primary school to work with HCA Hospice Care, enabling its students and staff to better empathise with different segments of the local community.

In 2015, the Ministry of Education Kindergarten@Frontier was set up within the premises of Frontier Primary School to provide affordable quality preschool education to the local community. In 2018, the kindergarten became part of the school, enabling a smooth transition from kindergarten to primary education.

#### **School Motto**
Make A Difference, Be The Difference

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/frontierpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The word ‘Frontier’ urges Frontierers to forge ahead and achieve breakthroughs in new boundaries. The word is placed in the school logo to remind students of their aspirations to evolve and expand beyond the status quo.

The student in the school logo is represented by colour of orange to show that students will shine brightly and bring brilliance to their future paths and destinations. They will blaze a trail for the school, community and country. The students will embrace the future with confidence and competence. The school is committed to focus on every child and nurture him/her to the best he/she can be.

To realise the school vision, a strong foundation in Values, Knowledge and Competencies denoted by the grey spheres has to be built. These three areas will be infused in a dynamic culture of learning. This culture includes a progressive curriculum which is holistic and attuned to the diverse students’ needs. This culture of learning is also enabled by committed and caring staff – captured by the green swerve which propels the child towards excellence.
