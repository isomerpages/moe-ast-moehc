#### **School History**
Jurong West Secondary School (JWSS) was established on 2 January 2001 along Jalan Boon Lay. On 18 March 2002, the school moved to the current 3.1-hectare premises, which boast facilities such as computer and science laboratories and special rooms for art, music and dance. The sports facilities included an astro-turf for hockey, an indoor sports hall and an artificial turf as the school field. Further infrastructural enhancements carried out between 2015 and 2019 saw the addition of The Book Room, The Learning Hive, The Loft (a student lounge designed by students for students) and other learning spaces to nurture the joy of learning and enhance student well-being.

In its early years, the school achieved numerous awards including Sustained Achievement Awards (in physical fitness, sports, aesthetics, uniformed groups) as well as attaining niche status in Uniformed Groups. In 2014, the school was selected as one of 12 prototype schools for Subject-Based Banding. 2016 saw the launch of&nbsp;_J_e_W_el, the school’s talent development in English, Mathematics, Science, Art and Sports. In 2017, it began offering the Enhanced Art Programme.

In 2015, as a response to the changing global and national landscape, the school underwent a re-envisioning exercise, which set the trajectory for the school to focus on nurturing future-ready learners, thinkers and leaders with the new school vision - ‘A Values-centred Community where Learning Is Ignited by Passion, Thinking Driven by Innovation and Leading Inspired by Service’.

Guided by this vision, the school strives to provide an exciting and holistic Jurong West (JW) Experience to all its students, which comprises academic guidance and joy of learning for academic excellence, varied opportunities locally and overseas, as well as a positive and conducive school environment for students to discover, develop and excel holistically. Student voice and choice play central roles in school programmes and activities to engender high levels of motivation and engagement in the students’ holistic pursuits.

Over the years, the school has established itself as a choice school with several distinctive programmes such as the Member of Parliament Attachment Programme and the offering of subjects such as Computing as well as Exercise and Sports Science. Come 2020, the school will be one of the pilot schools for Full Subject Based Banding (FSBB).

#### **School Motto**
Where Eagles Dare

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/jurongwestsec1.png">

The eagle represents strength of character, guarding the virtues of the school which are embodied within the school crest. The contoured shape and design of the crest is reminiscent of the badges of the guardians of society, signifying discipline. Above the eagle’s head and outspread wings are the initials of the school. The school’s virtues are represented by the four symbols in the two halves of the crest.

Two clasped hands forming the shape of a heart symbolise the school’s aspiration to nurture individuals who will serve the needs of the community as a leader. The atomic symbol represents the need to be technologically oriented as mankind explores the realms of the digital age. An unconventional square bulb symbolises innovative thinking. A flaming torch representing the passion for lifelong learning is placed over a scroll, signifying academic excellence, the former taking precedence over the latter. Finally, displayed at the base of the crest is the school motto, reinforcing the courage of the eagle.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fD7CBTpF8tb9ZzUQqCfNmIBdWQwwDNm6/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a> 

**_Verse 1_**<br>
Dreams can be broken<br>
But hope is over the rainbow<br>
With our strength of character and majestic flight  
We'll hold the dreams with our claws<br>
We'll shine, oh what a sight!<br>
Oh yes, we will fly to the sky,

_**Chorus:**_<br>
Perched proudly as we see our destiny,<br>
We'll be where dreams turn to reality,<br>
Yes, we will soar, touch the sky, move the earth<br>
We'll make a diff-er-ence, where eagles dare!

**_Verse 2:_**<br>
Challenges come but we dare<br>
To overcome them all<br>
With our powerful wings and eagle eyes<br>
We'll meet the challenges with our claws without a sight<br>
Oh yes, we will fly to the sky
