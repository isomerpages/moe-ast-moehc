#### **School History**
Buona Vista Secondary School was established on 16 January 1967. Located between Commonwealth Crescent and Holland Close in the Chip Bee Garden HDB estate, the school was first known as Chip Bee Secondary School. The school had its official opening on 5 July 1968 and was renamed Buona Vista Secondary School.  
  
The school was unique in being one of three government schools at the time that conducted classes in the English, Chinese and Malay language. Since its inception in 1967, the school did well especially in the extra-curricular activities (ECA), with its water polo, sepak takraw and soccer teams participating at district and inter-school levels, and winning several championships.   
  
In 1997, the school’s National Cadet Corps (NCC) became the first secondary school unit to be selected to perform at the silent precision drill at the NCC Day national celebrations at the Safti Military Institute.   
  
Buona Vista Secondary School merged with Queensway Secondary School in 2001.  
  
Last Serving Principal:<br>
\- Mrs Feng Moh Cheng (1996 - 1999)
