<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Kranji Primary School was established as a Government co-educational school
in 1997 to meet the needs of the growing population of young families in
Choa Chu Kang New Town. The school was officially declared opened on 3
July 1999 by Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, then Minister for Communications and Information
Technology and Member of Parliament for Hong Kah GRC.</p>
<p>The school grew rapidly and soon underwent PRIME in 2002 as part of the
Ministry of Education's (MOE) efforts to renew and support schools in Singapore
so as to provide a conducive learning environment for students. Through
this programme, Kranji Primary had the opportunity to expand and upgrade
its facilities, giving it more room to innovate in teaching and learning
and better engage the students. &nbsp;An opening ceremony was held for
the redeveloped campus. Then Minister for Transport and MP for Hong Kah
GRC, Mr Yeo Cheow Tong, was invited as the Guest of Honour once again to
grace the event.</p>
<p>In 2005, a new house system was developed to bring Kranjians of different
levels and streams together to foster team spirit and bonding. The four
houses were named after constellations - Delphinus, Monoceros, Taurus &amp;
Ursa Major to symbolise the school’s aspirations in reaching for the stars.
Students were assigned to the Houses upon their admission to the school
and remained as members of their Houses until they graduated from the school.
All members of the staff were also assigned to Houses, with an appointed
House Master/Mistress leading the House in the various school events and
activities held throughout an academic year, assisted by the Assistant
House Master/Mistress.</p>
<p>Kranji Primary celebrated its 10th&nbsp;anniversary in 2006 with a carnival
– “Fan10sia”. Members of the public were invited to join in the festivities
with the staff and students.</p>
<p>2010 was a significant year for Kranji Primary. The school won the West
Zone Inter-Primary Schools Basketball Championship in all 4 divisions and
<br>was also crowned the National Champions for the Junior and Senior Boys’
Inter-Primary Schools Basketball Championships. Due to the comprehensive
programmes and sustained achievements, Kranji Primary was the first and
only primary school in Singapore that was awarded the prestigious “Programme
for School-Based Excellence” Award by MOE for its excellence in basketball
from 2007 to 2011. In 2012, the school was once again honoured with the
status of renewal for this award.</p>
<p>Kranji Primary began operating as a single session school in 2013. With
access to school resources and facilities for the whole day, the school
enjoyed greater flexibility in timetabling and could introduce more after-school
enrichment programmes and extra-curricular activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Kranji Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) in Developing Champions in Life through Sports, a natural extension
from the school’s niche programme in basketball. Our LLP adopts a whole-school
approach to develop Kranjian Champions and build their character through
sports.</p>
<p>The school incorporated the CCA programmes within school hours in 2018,
so as to encourage full participation among the Primary Three to Primary
Six students. Primary One and Primary Two students were engaged in sports
activities through the PAL programme and the annual Budding Champions Day.</p>
<p>2018 also marked Kranji Primary’s 21st&nbsp;year in education, and this
was complemented with the completion of the PERI upgrading. There were
new additions such as the Indoor Sports Hall, a Butterfly Garden, and special
rooms such as the Life Skills Room and the Teaching Lab. These new facilities
and special rooms brought about an enhanced learning experience for the
students. In addition, a Student Care Centre was also established for after-school
care. The school celebrated this joyous occasion with aplomb, and Mr C.
Kunalan was invited as the Guest of Honour to officiate the opening of
the Indoor Sports Hall to mark the occasion amidst other celebratory activities.</p>
<p>MOE Kindergarten @ Kranji was established in 2019. With a strong team
of early childhood educators, 60 K1 students were enrolled as the pioneer
batch of MK-Kranji students and assimilated quickly into the school’s learning
environment. In addition, K-Care was also established to provide care for
the pre-school students before and after school hours.</p>
<p>Kranji Primary continues to maintain and upgrade its facilities. The school
library was renovated and given a facelift in 2019. The school facade was
also spruced up with a fresh coat of paint in 2020.</p>
<p>In 2020, Kranji Primary embarked on its Applied Learning Programme (ALP)
which leverages on the strengths of the school in the teaching and learning
of Mathematics and Science to facilitate inquiry-based learning and develop
children in their critical and inventive thinking skills. Our ALP aims
to connect classroom learning with real-life applications and encourages
students to creatively apply concepts to solve authentic problems. It focuses
on evoking curiosity in learning, developing inventive thinking and encouraging
a dare-to-try spirit, while tapping on the affordances of technology in
the form of digital portfolios, digital platforms, and digital devices,
to augment the learning experience for our students. A Maker Space was
created to allow our students to tinker and make prototypes of their solutions.</p>
