#### **School History**
CHIJ (Katong) Primary is one of the 11 schools set up by the Infant Jesus (IJ) Sisters in Singapore. Katong Convent was established in 1930 as a private English primary school with an enrolment of 197 pupils. In order to cope with the growing demand for places in the school, a branch was set up in Opera Estate in 1958, and a few of the primary school staff were transferred to the new convent, which was named CHIJ Opera Estate.   
  
In 1988, work on the project to build a new school at Marine Terrace began. CHIJ Opera Estate was then relocated to Katong in 1990. It merged with the primary section of Katong Convent and adopted the name CHIJ (Katong) Primary. The blessing of the school took place on 16 November 1990, and the school was officially opened in 1991.  
  
In 2007, the school was rebuilt under PRIME. After two years, the school moved back to a larger and more spacious building with up-to-date facilities. The new school building was officially opened in 2009.

#### **School Motto**
_Simple Dans Ma Vertu, Forte Dans Devoir (French Version)<br>
__Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty (English Version)_

To be **Simple in Virtue** is to cultivate a personal honesty which helps us relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity. Virtue is nobleness of character nurtured by a genuine desire to live according to God’s will as revealed in the Gospel.

To be **Steadfast in Duty** is to be faithful in fulfilling our obligations and having the capacity to rise above difficulties or obstacles to execute and complete a task in the service of others.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/chijkatongpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The CHIJ badge or crest (called the Blason, in French) was designed by Mere Saint Aloysia, Superior General (1877 – 1901) and her senior students of 1894.

At the centre of the school crest lies a red shield with a silver band edged in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of Gospels with a silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield, surmounted by a gold cross, is encircled by a garland of marguerites. Emblazoned on the crest is the motto of all CHIJ schools:-

The **cross** is the symbol of our salvation and the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The open **Gospel** represents the teachings of Christ and is a source of inspiration that guides the school community. The **silver** **rosary** symbolizes prayer and is the story of the Gospel as seen through the eyes of Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

The **golden distaff** and **spindle** are symbols of womanly labour and remind us of the dignity of work and the satisfaction and fulfilment to be found in a task well-accomplished.

The **red shield** symbolizes God’s all-embracing message of love.

The garland of **marguerites** is symbolic of purity and simplicity – charming traits of girlhood.
