#### **School History**
In the 1970s, a group of prominent alumni from Victoria School proposed to the Ministry of Education to establish a junior college named after Victoria. Their vision became a reality when Victoria Junior College (VJC) was established in 1984 with its pioneering cohort of staff and students.

The school’s architecture was based on an award-winning design. Known as the ‘College by the Sea’, VJC is located along a beautiful stretch of the East Coast Parkway at 20 Marine Vista. It was officially opened in 1985.

With a firm belief in the motto, ‘Nil Sine Labore’ – Latin for ‘Nothing Without Labour’ – VJC’s staff and students worked hard and played hard, quickly establishing the college as one of the nation’s top junior colleges. In 1987, VJC became one of five colleges to offer the Humanities Programme. Two years later, it became the first college to offer Theatre Studies and Drama as a General Certificate of Education A-Level subject. VJC was also the first to offer the French Elective Programme from 1991 to 2006, when the teaching of foreign languages was moved to the Ministry of Education Language Centre. In 1990, VJC established its own Science and Mathematics Enrichment Centre, which in 2002 became the Centre of Research in Science and Technology for East Zone schools. The college also became the first to offer sailing as a co-curricular activity (CCA) with its own sailboats in 1990.

VJC is well known for its strong academic programmes as well as its diverse and successful CCAs. Its choir and the symphonic band have won several local and overseas competitions since the 1980s. In sports, VJC was dominant in squash and hockey in the 1980s; since then, other sports like soccer, volleyball, floorball and wushu have come to the fore. Today, dance is a popular and equally successful CCA in the college.

In 2005, VJC started the Victoria Integrated Programme in which selected students could skip the O-Level and spend four years in the college leading up to the A-Level. This was later replaced by the Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA-IP), launched in 2011. VJC received its first cohort of VCA-IP students in 2015.&nbsp;In 2019, Siow Mein Yeak, Yue became the fifth Victorian, and the first from the VCA-IP,&nbsp;to be awarded&nbsp;the President’s Scholarship.

#### **School Motto**
Nil Sine Labore (Nothing Without Labour)

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/victoriajc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

Yellow is the colour of royalty in Asian cultures. In today’s context, it takes on meanings that were once associated with royalty, including dignity, leadership and a concern for the welfare of others. The colour red symbolises universal brotherhood and equality of humanity. The open book signifies the knowledge and wisdom acquired through lifelong learning. The torch represents truth and the passing on of a tradition. It also illuminates the way for students who venture forth to excel beyond Singapore.

Victoria in Singapore<br>
There are other schools we know<br>
Victoria is something more<br>
The school that watch'd us grow

For here we've learnt and striven too<br>
And played the sportsman's game<br>
Victoria, we give to you<br>
The honour that you claim

Victoria thy sons are we<br>
And we will not forget<br>
Victoria thy triumphs see<br>
And victories we share yet

For others came before and went<br>
And carried to the world<br>
Victoria's fame and our intent<br>
To keep her flag unfurled
