#### **School History**
Established in 1967, Toh Tuck Primary School was located at Toh Tuck Road.  
  
In 1987, Toh Tuck Primary School closed and the remaining students of Toh Tuck Primary School were transferred to Bukit Batok Primary School.Â   
  
From 1990 to 2011, the former site of Toh Tuck Primary School was used by the Canadian International School Singapore. From 2013 to 2014, Nanyang Primary School used the former Toh Tuck Primary School building to house the Primary One and Two classes during the upgrading of their own school campus. The school building was subsequently demolished and is currently being redeveloped for private housing.
