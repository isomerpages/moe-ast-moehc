#### **School Motto**
We look ahead

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/peitongpri1.png">

The letters ‘PT’ stand for Pei Tong (培童), which means ‘nurturing the young’. The proximity of the letters represents the close rapport between students and teachers. It also signifies the close relationship between parents and teachers. The crest is an emblem of the importance of these intricate relationships in our endeavour to develop each child to his/her fullest potential. The motto of the school, ‘We look ahead’, reiterates the vision of the school’s founders – to nurture the young and prepare them for their roles in the future.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Let us grow in strength and wisdom<br>
With heart and soul, we do our best<br>
We know for sure with good system<br>
We will succeed when put to test.<br>
To our school we all give honour<br>
We learn and play in healthy ways.
  
Our country we cherish and adore<br>
We all pledge to be strong and true.<br>
Take courage friends for we are one<br>
Respect one another honour our elders<br>
Diligent stead-fast in all that we do<br>
This is the path to a bright future.
