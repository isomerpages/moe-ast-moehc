#### **School History**
Charlton School was established in 1955. The school originally began in 1949 as a Continuation School for 200 overaged students from after World War II. By 1954, it became a fully-staffed Primary English School with an enrolment of 280 students. While their school building was being completed, the students attended lessons at Serangoon English Afternoon School. Charlton School moved into its new premises in January 1955.

In the 1990s, to maximise the proximity of the Paya Lebar Swimming Complex, the school introduced the School Swimming Programme and initiated the School Annual Swimming Carnival to promote swimming.

In January 1991, Arozoo School merged into Charlton School. In April 1994, Charlton School made newspaper headlines when its Chinese orchestra won the gold medal in the Primary School Chinese Orchestra/ Instrumental Ensemble Central Judging Contest.

In 2003, Charlton School merged with Xinghua Primary School.
