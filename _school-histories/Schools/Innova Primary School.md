#### **School History**
Innova Primary School was established in 2008 at Woodlands Drive 17 to serve the community in Woodlands. The school believes that every Innovian is a champion who embraces the ‘can do’ spirit and dares to dream. The school envisions itself as an inspirational, innovative and inviting school where its student outcomes are to be champions of character, change and citizenry. 

Its Applied Learning Programme, Creative Problem Solving (CPS), adopts the FourSight Model. It progresses from the acquisition of basic CPS skills of working in teams to higher-level skills of planning and implementing of the ideas. This is the cornerstone of the school’s ALP, which aims to achieve 21st-century competencies for students. The programme develops students’ creativity, critical thinking and problem-solving skills through integration into the various subjects. At the end of each year, students celebrate their learning by presenting their projects to their parents and peers. 

Innova’s Learning for Life Programme is aligned with the Character and Citizenship Education curriculum to develop students into morally upright individuals and useful citizens through the inculcation of the I-STAR values. It aims to grow Innovians into caring, compassionate and empathetic citizens who will lead and inspire others to make a difference in the lives of others and the community at large while staying rooted to Singapore. 

Innova Primary School continually strengthens its partnership with the parents and the community to create more varied and holistic learning experiences to bring out the best in students. The school works closely with Innova Parents Support Group to develop a range of activities to provide opportunities for the parents to bond with their children.

This is the school where stars and champions are born, and anchored on values. We hope to inspire in them the passion for life-long learning, ability to adapt to changes and imbue in them the desire, discipline and dedication as a committed individual with a global mindset.

The letter ‘I’, which begins from the base as a stroke of a paint brush, represents the importance of being anchored on values and purpose. As it reaches the top, the digitised format represents being relevant to the present and ready for the future. The orange colour symbolises the vibrant and dynamic environment in the school. The red star, which is dancing and rejoicing, represents a bright and happy student of Innova celebrating success. It embodies the Chinese name of Innova, 星烁小学, which connotes the potential of the students to be bright and shining stars.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

**Verse 1**<br>
We aim for excellence, with the base of integrity<br>
We are young, we dare to dream, we do believe  

We’ll be champions of character<br>
To always strive to be better<br>
We serve our Nation with pride and passion; regardless where we are

**Verse 2**<br>
We have the strength to persevere, we know we can achieve<br>
We are young, we dare to dream, we do believe

We will be champions of change<br>
We can rise to challenges<br>
We will realize our potential; let’s lead by example
  
**Chorus:**<br>
Innova is our name<br>
This is the school to be<br>
Working hand in hand<br>
Help each other to succeed

Innova is our name<br>
I-STAR in you and me<br>
Together we create<br>
Our future for all to see<br>
We dare to dream
