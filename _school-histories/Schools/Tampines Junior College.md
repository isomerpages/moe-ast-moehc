#### **School History**
Tampines Junior College (TPJC) commenced operations at temporary premises with a pioneer cohort of 698 students and 33 teachers on 11 April 1986. On 20 December 1986, it moved to its current premises at 2 Tampines Avenue 9. Designed by P&T architects, TPJC received the Best Designed College Building Award in 1988. It was officially opened on 1 July 1988.

Under the leadership of founding principal Mr Yahya Aljaru, the students and staff of TPJC formulated a college vision and mission focused on academic excellence and character development, and developed programmes to achieve these two goals. The close collaboration and synergy between the pioneer students, staff and college management laid the foundation for the TPJCian identity. Each succeeding principal furthered and enriched this process of development.

In 2000, TPJC completed the upgrading of its premises, which saw the addition of two new blocks with more classrooms, a rock wall and a library, among other things. TPJC offered the Language Elective Programme (Malay) and Drama Elective Programme from 2001 and 2007, respectively.

In 2006, a new extension comprising a cafe and a canteen was added to the campus. That same year also marked TPJC’s 20th anniversary, the opening of its heritage gallery and the start of the international twinning programme with Shandong Experimental High School in China. In addition, TPJC embarked on twinning programmes with Pusat Tingkatan Enam Meragang (Meragang Sixth Form Centre) from 2010 to 2014, and Pusat Tingkatan Enam Tutong (Tutong Sixth Form Centre) from 2015 to 2017, both located in Brunei Darussalam.  

In 2017, the Ministry of Education announced the merger of Tampines Junior College and Meridian Junior College. In 2018, TPJC celebrated its 32nd and final anniversary as a college with a Birthday Carnival. The commemorative time capsule was sealed by Minister for Finance Mr Heng Swee Keat and buried during the opening ceremony of the combined Tampines JC and Meridian JC Heritage Gallery.

On 8 December 2018, TPJC held its ‘Last Assembly’ event to mark the closure of the college premises.

#### **School Motto**
Aim and Achieve

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/tampinesjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The name of the college, ‘Tampines’, is prominently displayed on the crest. The two large stylised letters, ‘JC’, which stand for ‘Junior College’, form a triangle with a wide base and an apex. The broad, strong base signifies the principle of focusing on the holistic development of students, upon which the college is founded.

The apex features the college motto, ‘Aim and Achieve’, suggesting the upward thrust (Aim) of continuously working, and to excel (Achieve) in all areas of activities. The colour gold stands for the quality of excellence that is inherent in all attainments, whilst the colour red reflects steadfastness in the determination of the students to achieve this excellence.
