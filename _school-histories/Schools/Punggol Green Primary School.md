#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/punggolgreenpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest embodies the school’s aspirations. The orange rising Sun symbolises the bright and vibrant future the students strive for. They are guided by the six rays of the Sun which represent the school’s six core values: respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity, care and harmony. The blue globe underscores the school’s mission to nurture students holistically, urging them to be innovative, forward-looking, and global in their outlook. The figurine reaching for the star serves as a reminder to students to set their targets high, persevere and excel in life. The colour green signifies the school’s desire to contribute to the betterment of the environment.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

I look towards the East and I see a shining star;<br>
It’s beckoning to me saying there you are.<br>
Do follow me my friend, let me point the way;<br>
Let your dreams all come through, come what may.

My friends and I will share all the good things we have learnt,<br>
And build a school that shines like a hundred candles burn.<br>
And as we run the mile, till we reach the crest;<br>
Let us wish all our friends, all the best.

Believe, believe, never ever say we can’t;<br>
Achieve, achieve, all the dreams you want;<br>
Re-live re-live, places you’ve been, our Punggol Green.

Oh Punggol Green my school, you will always be my star;<br>
You’ve taught us very well and you’ve set the bar.<br>
And the values that we’ve learnt,<br>
They will guide us through.  
  
All the time, in the things, that we do.
