#### **School History**
Founded on 11 January 1954 with an enrolment of 400 students, Pearl Bank School was formerly known as Sepoy Lines School I. The school was renamed when it moved to Pearl’s Hill on 15 June 1954.  
  
The school merged with Park Road School (Sepoy Lines School II) in 1985 to form Pearl Park Primary School.
