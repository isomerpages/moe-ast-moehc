#### **School History**
Raffles Girls’ Primary School was established by the trustees of Raffles Institution on 4 March 1844 at Bras Basah Road. The school started as a centre for moral development and vocational training for girls.

In 1847, the school separated from Raffles Institution. Between 1870 and 1881, it moved from one building to another as the boys’ school continued to expand. By 1879, the school had started classes on its own and taken on the name, ‘Raffles Girls’ School’. In 1883, the school was housed in its own building within the grounds of Raffles Institution. In 1928, Raffles Girls’ School moved to its own premises on Queen Street.

During the Japanese Occupation, the school had to vacate the school building on Queen Street. In 1945, the school reopened in St Anthony’s Convent as the Queen Street premises was badly in need of repairs. In 1946, the premises at Queen Street reopened and primary classes were started in the afternoon.

In 1959, when the secondary school section moved to its own premises on Anderson Road, Raffles Girls’ Primary School became a full-fledged primary school at the Queen Street campus.

In 1979, Raffles Girls’ Primary School was relocated to Holland Grove Road. In 1984, the school became one of the first two primary schools selected for the Gifted Education Programme. In 1999, the school relocated to its present premises at Hillcrest Road. In 2016, the school completed PERI upgrading and became a single-session school. In 2019, Raffles Girls’ Primary School celebrated its 140th anniversary of formal establishment and 60th anniversary as a full-fledged primary school.

Raffles Girls’ Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Nurture Confident Communicators’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Developing Creativity through Collaborative Music Making’.
