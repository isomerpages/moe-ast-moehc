#### **School History**
Established in 1951, Ama Keng School was located at Ama Keng Road. The school started off offering only English-medium lessons.  
  
In the 1970s, the school introduced Chinese-medium lessons. By 1987, these Chinese-medium lessons were phased out.  
  
In 1990, Ama Keng School merged with Nam San School to form South View Primary School. Since then, South View Primary School has been located at Choa Chu Kang Central. The former school building of Ama Keng School has been used as a hostel for foreign workers.
