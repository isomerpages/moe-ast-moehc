#### **School History**
Yishun Secondary School was established in January 1986 as a government co-educational school at 4 Yishun Street 71. The school was officially opened on 19 August 1988. It became single-session in 1999. In 2002, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, which saw the addition of gardens and ponds to create a conducive common space for students and staff to meet, discuss and interact.

In 2011, the school celebrated its 25th anniversary with one of the key events being the launch of the School Heritage Walk. In 2016, the school celebrated its 30th anniversary, which was joined by various charity organisations.

In 2014, Yishun Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Sonic Arts, which leverages Music, Media and Technology. The programme provides students with a foundation and exposure to established and emerging disciplines such as Music Technology and Recording Arts (Music and Media). Yishun Secondary School is the first school in Singapore to have an ALP in Sonic Arts.

In 2015, Yishun Secondary School launched its Learning for Life Programme in Community and Youth Leadership, which focuses on providing students with opportunities to lead in serving the community. The programme is an extension of Values-In-Action experiences, and helps broaden Yishunites’ understanding of the needs and aspirations of the community through authentic experiences. It also helps develop leadership skills and attitudes.

#### **School Motto**
We Seek, We Strive, We Soar

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/yishunsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is in the shape of a water droplet, which symbolises the thirst for knowledge. The branches represent the school’s three core values that form the guiding principles to achieve the three desired outcomes for an Yishunite. The progressive growth of the branches indicates the different stages of learning that students have to go through before achieving their ultimate goal. The circle symbolises the fruits of labour that can be achieved through dedication, determination and self-discipline. The blue background signifies the students reaching out to seize the rich expanse of possibilities in the new economy through innovation and enterprise.
