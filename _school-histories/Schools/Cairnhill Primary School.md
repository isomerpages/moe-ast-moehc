#### **School History**
Cairnhill Primary School was established in 1958 at Anderson Road. Cairnhill Primary School was initially an all-girls school. A year later, it shifted to 136 Cairnhill Road and became a co-ed school, accepting both male and female students. The school building had been built to host a capacity of 900 students.  
  
Over time, due to population shifts to new towns and out of the Cairnhill area, enrolment numbers in the school fell from 611 in 1976 to 434 in 1980. The school eventually closed down in 1980. Cairnhill Primary School’s students were provided alternative places in nearby schools such as Monk’s Hill Primary and Anthony Road Girls’ School. The school’s building underwent renovations and subsequently hosted Anglo Chinese School (Junior) from 1985 to 2008. Since 2008, the site is occupied by the Ministry of Education Language Centre (Newton).
