#### **School History**
Established in 1959, Bukit Batok East Primary School was located at Jalan Jurong Kechil.&nbsp;  
  
In 1983, the school was one of ten schools invited to take part in the Horticulture and Aquarium Fish Show. Its students created their garden that was showcased in the exhibition.  
  
In 1984, the school merged with Bukit Batok West Primary School due to its low enrolment rates and was named Bukit Batok Primary School. Today, the school is known as Bukit Timah Primary School.
