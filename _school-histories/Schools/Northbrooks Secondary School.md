#### **School History**
Northbrooks Secondary School was established at the dawn of a new millennium on 2 January 2000. The name ‘Northbrooks’ is derived from the Chinese Yuan Dynasty proverb ‘饮水思源’. This is one of the core moral values inculcated in all Brooksians: to always remember their roots and to be grateful to their family, teachers, friends and country for the success they achieve in life.

In 2005, the school launched its Stained Glass Art Programme as its signature programme, where students are empowered to express their creativity and develop their spirit of innovation. As the programme requires skill and patience, students working in teams will develop fortitude while learning to value each other’s strengths.

In 2006, Northbrooks was the only school that year to be conferred the Inviting School Award, a testament to the school’s ability to maintain an inviting learning environment. In 2015, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in aerospace and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in outdoor education. Besides providing students with essential science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills, the ALP also gives them a competitive edge when applying for aerospace-related courses, which helps open up a career pathway for them in the rapidly growing aerospace industry. The school’s LLP, which is known as ‘A.C.E.’ (Adventure-Character-Environment), aims to develop character, inculcate values of grit and resilience, and build leadership traits in all students. In 2017, the school’s Water Learning Programme was established as a niche area focusing on multiagency collaboration to raise awareness on water sustainability.

Northbrooks Secondary is currently embarking on a new journey to become a Positive Education School in the future. It is focusing on specific skills that help students strengthen their relationships, build positive emotions, enhance personal resilience, promote mindfulness and encourage a healthy lifestyle.

#### **School Motto**
Soaring Yet Rooted

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/northbrookssec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Just as water is the basis of life, the school provides a nurturing and challenging environment to inspire all students to learn and grow. Just as trees, like aspens and giant redwoods that grow in groves supporting each other with their roots intertwined, people are also connected by a system of roots comprising family and friends. When pounded by the storms of life, the school community needs to hold each other up. Just like the oak, with its deep penetrating roots, withstands strong winds and violent storms, the school builds a strong foundation of moral values so that its students have the moral courage to make the right choices in life. Just as the spreading branches of the oak provides shelter against the sun and nesting places for birds, the school provides opportunities for students to develop their talents and abilities to the fullest, so that they in turn can reach out to touch the lives of others and make a positive difference to their community and the nation.

The gold background represents a firm foundation of sound moral values to guide their thinking, so that the students will have the confidence to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world. They will be well-balanced individuals, anchored by strong roots and equipped with the wings to soar to great heights to achieve their dreams with integrity. They will become people with values, and be of value to their community and their country.

#### **School Song**

With Brooksian fervour<br>
Lift up our voices<br>
Each day a new beginning<br>
Let hearts be open<br>
With hopes arising<br>
Our promises don’t deny.<br>
We’re friends who offer compassion<br>
Whatever the circumstance<br>
With fortitude we will overcome<br>
Be strong, be true, be free!<br>
Reach for tomorrow<br>
Take hold our future<br>
Let’s build a brighter new day<br>
We’re soaring, yet rooted<br>
Take flight<br>
And see hopes and dreams come true<br>
Our fears to conquer<br>
Stand tall<br>
Discover who we are and more<br>
Making champions of us all<br>
Volatilis Tamen Radicalis<br>
O see our dreams come true<br>
Our fears to conquer<br>
Stand tall<br>
Discover who we are and more<br>
Making champions of us all<br>
Making champions of us all!
