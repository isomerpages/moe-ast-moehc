#### **School History**
Established in 1966, Tiong Bahru Secondary School was located beside Lower Delta Road. It was one of the first bilingual&nbsp;integrated secondary schools after Singaporeâ€™s Independence in 1965.  
  
In the 1980s, student enrolment fell due to residential shifts. In 1991, Tiong Bahru Secondary School merged with Bukit Ho Swee Secondary School to form Delta Secondary School. In 2004, Delta Secondary School merged with Bukit Merah Secondary School.  
  
The former building of Tiong Bahru Secondary School was used as a temporary administrative head office of Nanyang Polytechnic. Since 2004, the former school building has housed the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board's Tiong Bahru Examinations Centre.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Ngui Jim Chiang (1966-1970)<br>
\- Mr Chung Chee Sang (1971 - 1978)

#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>


Beside Lower Delta Road stands Tiong Bahru<br>
A stately integrated Secondary School<br>
Her influence spreads, her beauty will grow<br>
As precious years go by as students come and go.<br>
This is the school where we play, where we grow.

This is our school where we learn to know<br>
Loyalty, honesty, kindness and dignity,<br>
Sportsmanship and humanity.<br>
Tiong Bahru Tiong Bahru, much you mean to us<br>
We earnestly strive, we persevere, we fuss<br>
To bring you Honour,<br>
To bring you Fame,<br>
To unfurl your flag,<br>
To honour your Name.
