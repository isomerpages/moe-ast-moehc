#### **School History**
Established in 1923, Chiang Teck School had its humble beginning in rented premises in Kampong Bahru. It served mainly poor Chinese children with Mandarin as the medium of instruction. The school later moved to Silat Road, where a block of four classrooms and a teacher’s hostel were built. The enrolment soon grew to 300 students. The school ceased operations during the Second World War, and was reconstructed in 1945 to serve some 500 students.

By 1961, the school had 24 classes with 1,004 students and 27 staff members. Zhangde (彰德)&nbsp;is the hanyu pinyin name for Chiang Teck. In August 1981, the school management committee decided to close the school to make way for developments in the area. In 1984, the school was re-established as Zhangde Primary School and was relocated to Jalan Bukit Merah. It started functioning on 10 September 1984 with students from Outram Primary School and Kai Ming Primary School. During the next few years, the school also took in students from Silat Primary School and Keppel Primary School when these schools closed down.

Zhangde Primary School moved to Jalan Membina, its current premises, on 30 December 2004. The school has transformed many of its physical spaces into learning galleries, learning gardens and outdoor classrooms for its students. In recognition of Zhangde’s green efforts, the school was awarded the Programme for School-Based Excellence in Environment Education in 2010.&nbsp; In 2012, the school underwent PERI upgrading. The school became single-session in 2013.

In March 2016, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Developing Zhangde GIVER3S Values through Environment Education’.

#### **School Motto**
Zeal, Progress and Success

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/zhangdepri1.png">

The motif is based on the letter ‘Z’ and the overall design is made up of the letter ‘Z’ and its reflected counterpart. In the centre is a vertical arrow paving the way for progress towards success, and at the horizontal base of the letter ‘Z’ is an open book symbolising education. The horizontal lines above represent a balance, symbolising holistic education where there is equal emphasis on both curricular and co-curricular aspects.

The mirror image of the letter ‘Z’ represents a reflective learner who is a role model at all times. The eight school values are represented by the lines under each letter ‘Z’, symbolising the school being anchored on the values and guided by them to provide a firm foundation for character building in all its students.

The school crest has a light blue background, signifying a resilient Zhangderen&nbsp;who thrives in the midst of change and challenges.
