#### **School History**
Hong Wen School was established in 1920 by the Hin Ann Huay Kuan, which was established in the same year. Originally located at Queen Street, the school was closed in 1923 due to an economic recession but reopened in 1925. It moved to Waterloo Street in 1926 and was closed again in 1941 during the Japanese Occupation. The school reopened in a rented building on Dickson Road after the liberation of Singapore in 1945.

Hong Wen School became a government-aided school in 1957 and later relocated to premises on Victoria Road in 1981. In the early 1980s, the school offered pre-primary classes and went through the transition from a Chinese-medium school to one that offered English as the first language and Chinese as the second language.

In 1992, Hong Wen School was accorded the Special Assistance Plan status, offering both English and Chinese as first languages.

The school was awarded the People Developer Standard by SPRING Singapore, and the Ministry of Education’s Sustained Achievement Award (Sports) in 2007. The school established its status as the South 4 Cluster Centre of Excellence for Chinese Cultural Arts in 2008. In that same year, the school attained its Programme for School-Based Excellence status in rope-skipping.

The school relocated to its present premises at Towner Road in 2009 after the completion of the PRIME upgrading. The new campus, accredited with the Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) Green Mark (Gold) Award, was officially opened in September 2010, in conjunction with the school’s 90th anniversary celebration.

In 2010, the school received its re-certification of the People Developer Standard by SPRING Singapore. The following year, the school attained its second Programme for School-based Excellence status in Wushu. That same year, the school also received the Ministry of Education’s Development Award for Character Development and the Sustained Achievement Award (Aesthetics).

In 2013, the school was accorded the status of South Zone Centre of Excellence for Chinese Cultural Arts.

In 2015, the school was accorded two Learning for Life Programmes (LLP) in Sports & Outdoor Education, as well as in Student Leadership and Community Service. That year, Hong Wen School celebrated its 95th anniversary.

In 2016, the school was conferred the Ministry of Education’s School Distinction Award, along with five Best Practice Awards: Character and Citizenship Education; Teaching and Learning; Student All-Round Development; Staff Well-Being and Development; and Partnership. In the same year, the school also received the BCA Green Mark (GoldPlus) Award in recognition of its efforts and achievements in environmental sustainability.

In September 2017, the school completed its 16-month PERI upgrading, which saw the construction of a new block and the upgrading of existing facilities.
