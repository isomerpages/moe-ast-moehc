<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 1939, Monk’s Hill Primary School was located at Winstedt
Road. The school started off as an all-boys school. Between April 1957
and December 1957, Hua Yi Secondary School shared the facilities of Monk’s
Hill Primary School before it moved to its own campus at Margaret Drive.
In 1969, Monk’s Hill Primary School admitted its first intake of female
students into the Primary One cohort. In the same year, Monk's Hill Primary
School also celebrated its 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>In 1978, Monk’s Hill Primary School merged with Newton Boys’ School. The
newly amalgamated school shared the campus of both schools and was named
Monk’s Hill Primary School. From 1978 to 1983, the Vocational and Industrial
Training Board shared one block of Monk’s Hill Primary School’s building.
In 1983, this block was used as the centre for third language lessons.</p>
<p>In 1987, Monk’s Hill Primary School closed. Along with the school, the
third language centre also closed in the early 1990s. From 1996 to 2000,
the Monk’s Hill Primary School building served as a temporary school site
for Madrasah Aljunied al-Islamiah. Since 2000, the former site of the school
has been occupied by the Lasalle College of the Arts (Winstedt Campus).</p>
