#### **School History**
Park View Primary School started in 1997 as a government co-educational single-session school at Pasir Ris Drive 1. It became double-session in 1999 but reverted to being single-session in 2010, when it adopted the recommendations of the PERI committee. In 2001, Park View Primary School underwent PRIME upgrading, and in 2016, it underwent PERI upgrading.

Since its establishment in 1997, the school has emphasised sports as a powerful way of developing values and 21st-century competencies. In 2008, the school was accorded the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Sports. In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in sports. Known as ‘Sports Experiential Programme’, the programme focuses on developing resilience when attempting challenging activities, taking care of others and building camaraderie through learning experiences such as camps and striving to do one’s best in all tasks.

In 2015, Park View Primary School was accorded a second Learning for Life Programme, ‘Leader in Me’, which aims to develop the leader in every child and encourage service to others. This programme has a strong focus on nurturing students with sound character and a sense of responsibility, giving opportunities for every student to experience leadership at various levels of challenges to enable them to grow in confidence.

In 2017, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary. In the same year, the school underwent a re-envisioning exercise to strengthen its purpose and also as a milestone check in consideration of changing global and educational landscapes. The PVPS family collectively decided to adopt the vision ‘Leaders of Character, championing Service and Excellence’ and the values, ‘Respect for All, Responsibility in Actions, Resilience in Adversity, Integrity Our Core, Care for Community, and Harmony in Diversity’; supported by the mission ‘To nurture future-ready students, anchored on values’.
