#### **School History**
Swiss Cottage Primary School also known as Sekolah Rendah Swiss Cottage, was established in 1963. It was one of the first integrated schools opened under the Integrated Schools Programme. It comprised English and Malay streams.

In October 1983, it was one of five schools that participated in a pilot scheme initiated by the Ministry of Education for the establishment of School Executive Committees (SEC) in schools. The purpose of the SECs is to develop a distinctive character and identity in each school, bring about innovation and improvement to the school, and foster closer links between the school and the community.

In 1985, the school published the inaugural edition of the Swiss Cottage Primary School Magazine. In 1999, Swiss Cottage Primary School won the Best Performer trophy in the National Track and Field Meet.

In January 2002, Swiss Cottage Primary merged with Moulmein Primary to become Balestier Hill Primary School.

In work and play we will do our best<br>

O come and sing as together we pledge.
