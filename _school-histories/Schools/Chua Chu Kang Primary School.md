#### **School History**
Chua Chu Kang Primary School (CCKPS) started operations on 2 January 1994 with 400 students from Primary One to Primary Four, using South View Primary School as the holding site. When the school moved to its present site in 1995, it had an enrolment of 1,500 students in 44 classes from Primary One to Primary Five. The school was officially opened in June 1997. Since its inception, the school has had five principals.

Character and Citizenship Education has been the cornerstone to develop each child academically, socially and morally. Hence, the school embarked on a programme of personal and social effectiveness for students based on Stephen Covey’s seven habits for highly effective people. The school’s core values have been aligned with the seven habits. Students learn and internalise these core values through a variety of means: stories, movie clips, songs, art, animal mascots, motivational badges and role-modelling.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘A Confident and Caring Leader – Leading Through C.A.R.E.’. With the extra support provided, the school funded level-wide leadership training workshops for all students.

The school was accorded the Programme for School-based Excellence (Robotics) in 2008 and the Applied Learning Programme in 2014. These have helped the school to expand and improve the quality of its robotics programme.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Raja Rajendra (1994–1999)<br>
\- Mrs Yue Yoke Mun (1999–2005)<br>
\- Mr Francis Foo (2005–2011)<br>
\- Mrs Lee Wai Ling (2011–2017)<br>
\- Mrs Sheree Chong (2017–present)

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/cckpri1.png">

The Circular band symbolises the school’s commitment to an all-round education.<br>
The book with its pages open signifies the school as an institution that emphasises learning as an on-going process.<br>
The pages and the spine of the book take on the form of a burning torch that signifies the passing on of knowledge, values and habits.<br>
The arrows show the way to excellence through Discipline and Diligence.<br>
The colour apple-green is symbolic of vitality, blue signifies graciousness, gold represents excellence, and flaming yellow stands for commitment.<br>
Together they depict Chua Chu Kang Primary School’s Motto – Excellence through Discipline and Diligence.
