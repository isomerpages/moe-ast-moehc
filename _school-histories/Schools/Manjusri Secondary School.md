#### **School History**
In June 1974, the Singapore Buddhist Federation decided to establish a Buddhist-affiliated secondary school on a site at Sims Drive offered by the Ministry of Education. The Buddhist spiritual leaders and monks named the school ‘Manjusri’ after the Bodhisattva of Great Wisdom. One of its initial aims was to provide Buddhist families with the option of having their children continue their secondary school studies in an environment that emphasised Buddhist virtues while still respecting Singapore’s religious diversity.

The building fund was raised from the Buddhist community and public well-wishers in the 1970s. Construction work began on 11 March 1978, and the campus was ready for use at the end of 1981. The year 1982 marked the founding of Manjusri Secondary School as the only Buddhist government-aided secondary school in Singapore.

The school embarked on a building expansion programme in December 1996, and this was completed in March 1999. In 2005, the school underwent the Ministry of Education’s PRIME upgrading programme, which saw its temporary relocation to Ubi, next to Maha Bodhi School. The two Buddhist-affiliated schools were brought closer together for greater synergy and collaboration.

Manjusri Secondary School moved to its new campus on 11 November 2008. Dr Ng Eng Hen, then Minister for Education and Second Minister for Finance, officially opened the new building on 22 April 2010.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Ng Siok Yen (1981–1984)<br>
\- Mr Tan Siah Kwee (acting principal; 1983–1984)<br>
\- Ms Ong Siew Lean (1985–1998)<br>
\- Mdm Alice Heng Sen Mee (1998–2004)<br>
\- Mrs Tay-Tan Yang Fern (2004–2010)<br>
\- Mr Low Chun Meng (2011–2016)<br>
\- Mr Sim Chong Boon (2017–present)

#### **School Motto**
智: ‘Wisdom’, which is like a lamp emitting light in a world of darkness. Manjusri was a disciple of Vairocana Buddha and he symbolises the Light of Wisdom.

行: ‘Conduct’, which is the action that leads to the future fulfilment of one’s goal in life. With wise and appropriate conduct we would not be led astray, but would achieve our goals and perform our duties in a disciplined manner.

慈: ‘Benevolence’, which is sympathy and universal love for all living beings. Being one of the most important aspects of Buddhism, benevolence brings happiness and alleviates mankind’s pain and suffering. Benevolence embraces all regardless of age, race and capabilities.

愿: ‘Aspirations’, which are like ambitions. Buddhists observe the Four Aspirations: better conduct, self-improvement, pursuit of truth and preservation of all life.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/manjusrisec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest has an oriental design consisting of the letter ‘M’ (‘Manjusri’), which stands out in bold maroon with a graceful lotus resting on it. A thin border of pale red defines the badge, giving it added character and uniqueness. The white lotus is symbolic of the school’s aim and ideal to instil in students the purity of thought and exemplary behaviour through Buddhism. The colour maroon signifies brotherhood, warmth and sincerity, while pale red denotes youthfulness and vitality.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Bodhisattva Manjusri, the light of wisdom<br>
Glowing in our hearts and illuminating our minds.<br>
Free us from greed, anger and ignorance<br>
As we strive for exemplary conduct.<br>
Forward we move with our heads held high.<br>
With great loving kindness and compassion,<br>
We help all sentient beings.

With wisdom,<br>
We overcome all delusions.<br>
While we wait for the Lion to stand and roar.<br>
The Truth of the Dharma,<br>
The teachings of the Buddha,<br>
Forever shining and bright.

**Chinese**<br>
文殊师利，智慧之光，<br>
闪耀在青年学生的胸膛。<br>
远离贪嗔痴，树立道德风范，<br>
指引学生向前方。<br>
启大慈悲，普度众生，挥智慧剑，破除迷障。<br>
只等待雄狮奋起，吼声震荡，<br>
佛陀真理放光芒。
