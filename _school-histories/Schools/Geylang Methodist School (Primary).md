#### **School History**
Geylang Methodist School (Primary) was established as Geylang Methodist Girls’ School in 1924 with 27 students. It was set up by Rev Lloyd Sullivan (district superintendent), together with Mrs Chia Han Kiat and Ms Emma Walker, members of the Methodist Church. The school’s mission was to provide basic education to girls in an impoverished Geylang area.

The need for more space and facilities became more apparent, and in 1984 the school went co-educational and split into two schools: Geylang Methodist Primary and Secondary schools, located in Geylang East Central. Geylang Methodist Primary School functioned as a single-session school until 1995 when the enrolment grew and it had to have two sessions. To meet the increased enrolment, Geylang Methodist Primary School underwent PRIME upgrading, which was completed in 2003.&nbsp;

In 2007, the school celebrated its 83rd anniversary and was renamed Geylang Methodist School (Primary). The PERI upgrading project began in 2012 with more facilities and special rooms to provide holistic education and diverse needs for its students. The upgrading was completed in March 2017.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘GM Earth Warriors Environment Education’, aims to inculcate in students a sense of responsibility to society through student advocacy for environmental issues that are close to their hearts. Through the programme, students imbibe key values such as respect and compassion as they learn to be compassionate leaders as well as useful and responsible citizens.&nbsp;

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Heng Gaik Kee (1984–1995)<br>
\- Ms Mabel Wee (1996–2007)<br>
\- Mrs Rina Liang (2008–2015)<br>
\- Mrs Jennifer Choy (2016–present)

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/geylangmethodistpri1.png">

The School Crest is the embodiment of our aims and aspirations for Geylang Methodist School. The shield offers protection and reminds us of the Lord God who is our strength, our help and our shield.

At the heart of the shield is a flaming torch formed by the letters ‘M’ and ‘S’. This torch symbolises the passion of GMS to seek the Light and Truth in Jesus Christ who is the Light of the World, and whose Truth will set us free.

The white 27-point starburst is inspired by our heritage when the school started with 27 girls in 1924. It motivates us to strive for purity, integrity and excellence in our holistic education.

The colours blue and gold frame our crest and represent heaven and earth respectively, reflecting our heavenly aspirations which are firmly grounded in our earthly realism to ‘Grow in Friendship, Body and Mind’.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18qcEr17GvXm0MhWRZZGV8X3GSKEcnBub/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a> 


In Geylang Methodist we strive<br>
To grow in friendship, body and mind<br>
And never fail to keep alive,<br>
The Truths of God which guide mankind.<br>
With grateful hearts we sing the praise,<br>
Of Geylang Methodist today<br>
And to her glory now we raise<br>
Our pledge of loyalty for aye.<br>
When from each other we must part<br>
And cares of life around us press<br>
One thing will live within each heart<br>
The memory of GMS.
