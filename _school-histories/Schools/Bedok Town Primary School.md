Unity is Strength

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bedoktownpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The first two initials of Bedok Town Primary School are B and T. The stylised form of the two initials are combined to form a **tree** – a symbol of strength. This unity of the initials into a tree of strength symbolises the school motto “Unity is Strength”.

Surrounding the tree is a **circle**, formed by two semicircles of two different colours. The two semicircles represent the bilingual education policy. Together, they help make the complete person as symbolised by the perfect circle.

Let us pledge our all to work together<br>
Let us strive our best to unite forever<br>

Always our motto be<br>
Success and honour achieved for thee<br>
Success and honour achieved for thee<br>

Onward toward our goal<br>
With one heart and one mind<br>
