#### **School History**
Established in 1956, North Vista Secondary School started as Gan Eng Seng Government Chinese Middle School. It was one of the four Chinese middle schools set up by the government to provide a conducive and safe environment for students who wanted to complete their education at a time when the political situation in Singapore was very volatile. The school temporarily operated from Gan Eng Seng School on Anson Road and lessons were conducted in the afternoon.

In 1958, the school was renamed as Thomson Government Chinese Middle School when it moved to its own premises at 5000 Thomson Road. A decade later, in 1969, the school underwent another major restructuring when it merged with Thomson Vocational School to become Thomson Secondary School.

The school became double-session from 1969 to 1991 with lower secondary, upper secondary and pre-university classes. In 1991, the pre-university classes ceased and the school became single-session. In 2000, Thomson Secondary School relocated to 11 Rivervale Link and was renamed North Vista Secondary School. The Chinese name of Thomson Secondary School (德新中学) was maintained to preserve its historical links with the new school.

In 2006, the school kicked off its 50th-anniversary celebration with a torch relay-cum-homecoming from its first campus on Anson Road, passing by its previous campus along Thomson Road and finally ending at its current premises at Rivervale Link.

In 2014, North Vista Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Investigative Science in Health and Sports’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Nurturing Creative Problem Solvers through the Arts and Design’, in the following year. The former develops students’ interest in learning through investigative science and forensics, while the latter aims to develop active citizens who are able to empathise with and respond creatively to the needs of the community.

The school logo is shaped like a globe with two hands supporting it. The globe represents the desire to develop a global outlook, while its golden glow signifies a new beginning. The two supporting hands symbolise the support for the students’ quest for knowledge, innovation and enterprise. The stylised and bold ‘NV’ symbol signifies a vibrant school. The school motto, ‘Viva La Vista’, is set beneath the initials. The ring around the globe represents an all-round development to achieve the desired outcomes of education.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We will stand up for North Vista<br>
With pride and commitment<br>
We'll triumph in knowledge and wisdom<br>
To give our school a name

Let all our hearts be strong and stirring<br>
Our colours flying high<br>
In whatever we endeavour<br>
We shall do the best we can

Come heed the call, Vistarians<br>
Onward we shall go<br>
With honour and glory before us<br>
Viva La Vista!
