#### **School History**
Tanjong Katong Secondary School was established in 1956 as Tanjong Katong Secondary Technical School, which offered technical education for boys. Located on Tanjong Katong Road, the school started its first pre-university classes in 1967 and became co-educational.

In 1993, the school was renamed as Tanjong Katong Secondary School. In 1996, the school became single-session. Three years later, the school moved to its present premises at 130 Haig Road. The new school building was officially opened on 22 April 2000. In 2005, Tanjong Katong Secondary School gained autonomous status.

In 2005, the school was recognised as the East Zone Centre of Excellence in Design Education.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/tanjongkatongsec1.png">

The school badge features an image of Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most versatile geniuses of modern times. Da Vinci was both a scientist and an artist, and hence represents one with an all-round education. The symbolism of flight in the emblem, represented by the bird and the flying machine, instils in students the desire to go beyond the realms of ordinary imagination and to achieve goals that no one has dared dreamt of before.

#### **School Song**
<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nhIgmfazKD-YwiivfXB9N-hIoNisDRHN/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a>

On the sea-shore of endless worlds,<br>
With the mind and with the body,<br>
We'll work together and we'll play,<br>
It's one for all and all for one.

Chorus:<br>
We'll seek and find,<br>
We'll make and mind,<br>
However hard, we'll strive to reach the goal.<br>
O Rutherford, Da Vinci, Tagore and Albert Einstein,<br>
We hope we have rightly invoked<br>
Your inspirations and your fame.
