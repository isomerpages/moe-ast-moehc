#### **School History**
The Guangyang journey began in 1918 in a humble shophouse next to a post office at the 5½ milestone, on Serangoon Road. Formal education was rare at the time – many could not afford to send their children to school. The birth of Kong Yiong School came about when a group of education enthusiasts saw the need to offer Chinese education at the primary level.

The early principals played an active role in raising funds. In 1930, their efforts paid off with the completion of a school building at 993B Yio Chu Kang Road. The school was temporarily closed in 1944 due to the Japanese occupation. It was reopened in 1945 after the war. In 1959, the school was renamed Kong Yiong High School, offering both primary and secondary education.

On 24 August 1968, a three-storey science block was built and declared open by then Minister for Education Mr Ong Pang Boon. A four-storey administration block was completed on 5 October 1975. In 1978, the school started offering bilingual education. In 1984, the school was split into secondary and primary schools. The primary school was converted into a government school; in 1988, it relocated to new premises in Ang Mo Kio and became known as Guangyang Primary School.

In 1986, the secondary school was closed due to declining enrolment. However, the following year saw the construction of a new school at 12 Bishan Street, and it was named ‘Guangyang’, which is the hanyu pinyin of 'Kong Yiong'. The school was officially opened on 27 June 1990.

Guangyang Secondary School underwent PRIME upgrading in 2002 and was temporarily located in Toa Payoh. In 2006, the school merged with Braddell-Westlake Secondary School and retained the name Guangyang Secondary School. In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in environmental science for sustainable living, and the Learning for Life Programme in the performing arts.

In 2018, the school celebrated its centenary with the theme, ‘Our Heritage, Our Strengths, Our Future’. The school continues to nurture students to be thinkers, leaders and advocates.
