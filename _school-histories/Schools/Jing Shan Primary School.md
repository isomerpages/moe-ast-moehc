#### **School History**
Jing Shan Primary School was founded in August 1944. It was built and funded by successful businessmen and villagers living in Chin San Village, where the current Serangoon Gardens estate stands today. Originally named Chin San Public School (青山学校), it was a Chinese-medium school that served the children living in the vicinity.

In the mid-1950s, Chin San Public School relocated to Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 from Chin San Village to make way for the development of Serangoon Gardens. The new school was built on a piece of land donated by Mr Tan Boon Kak (陈文确), the younger brother of philanthropist Mr Tan Lark Sye (陈六使).

Mr Tan Boon Kak believed that the school should always strive for excellence by continuously improving on the quality of its education. He mooted the idea of modifying the school name: By adding the Chinese character ‘争’ (strive) to the existing character ‘青’ (green), a new word ‘静’ (tranquil) was formed. The Chinese name of the school was thus changed to 静山小学.

In 1982, Chin San Public School became a full government school and changed its English name to Jing Shan Primary School. On 7 May 1982, it moved to its present site at 5 Ang Mo Kio Street 52. The school was officially opened on 6 July 1984. From 1999 to 2002, the school underwent PRIME upgrading.

In 2019, the school merged with Da Qiao Primary School. The merger synergised the signature programmes and good practices to deliver holistic education and inspired a re-envisioning of a future-oriented, student-centric, values-driven school. In March of the same year, construction started for the building of an indoor sports hall and the refurbishment of the school to enhance the infrastructure for the provision of quality education.
