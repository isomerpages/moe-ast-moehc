#### **School History**
Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School was founded by two Christian clergymen, Rev Tay Sek Tin and Rev Tan Leng Tian, in 1924. The school has a rich history involving the amalgamation and development of several schools since 1924. These schools included Katong Girls’ School, Choon Guan School, Choon Guan English School, Kuo Chuan Girls’ School, Koon Seng Road School, Dryburgh English School and Presbyterian Boys’ School. In 1985, Kuo Chuan Girls’ School and Presbyterian Boys’ School merged to form Kuo Chuan Presbyterian School, which functioned as a full school. In 1987, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian School developed into Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School. In the same year, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School moved to its current premises at Bishan Street 13. The school is government-aided and comes under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Singapore. The school is affiliated to Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School and caters to both boys and girls.

Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in ‘E-cube: Engage, Excite, Express’, and Learning for Life Programme in ‘Art and Design’.

#### **School Motto**
Aflame for Truth

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/kuochuanprespri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is circular in shape. In the inner circle, a book, the Bible, rests on top of a shield. The band of light radiating from the shield represents the light of God. In the centre of the shield is the ‘Burning Bush’. The red flames do not destroy the green bush as they are the supernatural flames of God. The dark blue colour represents the stability of the Christian faith, and white symbolises the purity and grace of God. The crest and the motto are drawn from the Book of Exodus, Chapter 3, verses 1 to 12 in the Bible. 

The crest speaks of God’s presence, guiding and inspiring the students to become upright and responsible people. The ‘Burning Bush’ is a befitting emblem to the school’s unfailing quest for Truth, with God as its mentor and guide.
