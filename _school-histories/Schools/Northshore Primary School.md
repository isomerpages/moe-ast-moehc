<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Northshore Primary School is one of the newly built schools in Singapore
and welcome her first batch of Primary 1 and Kindergarten 1 students in
January 2021. The primary school currently has 28 classes from Primary
1 to Primary 4. There is also the Northshore Kindergarten on the campus,
which provides high-quality preschool education for children aged five
to six.</p>
<p>Leveraging on our strategic location near the Punggol Digital District
and close proximity to Coney Island, we focus on STEM education and using
outdoor spaces to provide meaningful and authentic learning experiences
to promote environmental sustainability. In 2022, we partnered the Singapore
Science Centre's KidsSTOP to create authentic activities for the MK and
primary school students in environmental sustainability and STEM. Using
this experience of co-creation of lessons with KidsSTOP, we continue to
enhance our LLP experience for the students. Our LLP OCE@N (Outdoor Education
and Caring for our Environment @ Northshore) aims to develop students’
critical thinking skills and to build character through experiential learning
and exploring sustainability issues. Students are taught Outdoor Education
knowledge and skills through authentic learning experiences. Our ALP “imaginEErs
- Creativity unlocked: Excite . Explore . Excel” which focuses on Game
Design and Making, seeks to provide opportunities for our students to be
involved in exciting STEM hands-on activities and encourage them to explore
ideas, try out new skills such as basic coding, and be creative, placing
great emphasis on cultivating the joy of learning in them.</p>
<p>Games-based activities and hands-on experiences are designed to attract
students’ interest and pique their curiosity. During outdoor Programme
for Active Learning (PAL) lessons, students immerse themselves in their
surroundings and learn to appreciate Mother Nature by planting new plants
and caring for them. With the elevated landscape gardens and extensive
greenery on various levels within the school environment, as well as a
butterfly and herbs garden, students are able to extend their learning
outdoors in various subject lessons.</p>
<p>At Northshore, we believe that the ‘joy of learning’ must exist, where
students are given appropriate levels of challenges and are able to make
decisions about their learning. We truly believe in the critical catalyst
of designing activities that are relevant and interesting to build on the
learning in the classroom and take it forward to enrich our students’ overall
learning.</p>

<p>Our school colours are blue and orange. The colour blue signifies stability,
wisdom and confidence while orange signifies creativity, optimism and energy.</p>
<p>The N and S in the center of the school crest are shaped like a chain
to denote the strong link between the students and the school. The N also
represents the True North, an internal compass, which the school hopes
that our students will have within them to guide them to succeed in life.</p>
<p>The center ring is designed to look like a compass and the helm of a ship.
Below the center ring lies an open book and dots that represent the digital
world to encourage our students to acquire knowledge and skills through
various means.</p>
<p>Northshore Primary believes in inculcating our students with the school
S.M.A.R.T. values so that they navigate successfully through life challenges
and opportunities with the right core values, beliefs and attitudes.</p>

<p>Courageous Explorers</p>
<p>The sunrise lights up</p>
<p>the sea of possibilities before us all.</p>
<p>With courage we will explore</p>
<p>Our strengths and knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>Each challenge an adventure, to anchor our character.</p>
<p>We ride the waves, we steer ahead.</p>
<p>Courageous Explorers we are</p>
<p>Raise our sails and soar.</p>
<p>We learn with passion, dare to dream</p>
<p>Serve with all our hearts.</p>
<p>Courageous Explorers we are</p>
<p>We always find a way.</p>
<p>We learn with passion, dare to dream</p>
<p>Serve with all our hearts,</p>
<p>Northshoreans!</p>
