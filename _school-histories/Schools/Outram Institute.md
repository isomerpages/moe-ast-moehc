#### **School History**
The Ministry of Education set up the first institute, Outram Institute, to offer three-year pre-university courses. Outram Institute was established in 1987. The institute prepared students for the GCE 'A' Level Examinations. Initially, it concentrated on commerce subjects and had only the commerce stream. The arts stream was later introduced to the school.

In 1989, Outram Institute was the first pre-university centre in Singapore to offer the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry examination.

Besides focusing on academic achievements, and personal development and life skills, the Institute was also active in sports. Outram Institute participated actively at national-level sports competitions. In 1990 the girls’ basketball team won the National Schools Basketball Championship while the girls’ volleyball team won the National Schools Volleyball Championship for the first time.

In 2004, Outram Institute merged with Jurong Institute to become Millennia Institute, which is Singapore’s only centralised institute at present.

#### **School Song**
We are all one family<br>
We care for one another<br>
Whatever happens to our Institute<br>
Is our main concern.

**Chorus**<br>
Towards excellence we will strive<br>
Doing the best that we can offer<br>
In our studies, sports and service<br>
For our Institute and our nation,<br>
Studies, sports and service<br>
For our institute and our nation.

We must be adaptable, vigorous, persevering<br>
These will help us all excel<br>
When we work, play and serve.

We are all one family<br>
We care for one another<br>
These will help us all excel<br>
 When we work, play and serve.
