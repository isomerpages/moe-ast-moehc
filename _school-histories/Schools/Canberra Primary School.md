#### **School History**
Canberra Primary School was established in January 2000. The school adopted the name of the old Canberra School, which had closed down in 1988.   
  
The school initially operated from Wellington Primary School because its building at 21 Admiralty Drive was not ready. The school moved into its present premises in November 2000.   
  
Since its inception, Canberra Primary School has been leveraging the affordances of ICT in teaching and learning. It was one of the six schools to participate in the Ministry of Education-initiated EduQuest project in 2000. In 2005, it was selected as an incubator school and subsequently as a LEAD ICT school in 2006. In 2007, Canberra Primary School was one of the five schools selected for the FutureSchools@Singapore programme.    
  
In 2014, Canberra Primary School’s programmes for Applied Learning (_Start Young, Start It Right – Curating My Learning_) and Learning for Life (_Immersing in Canberra Experience through Musical Theatre Education_) were recognised as the school’s distinctive programmes. In 2015, the Ministry of Education awarded it the School Distinction Award and four Best Practice Awards (Teaching and Learning, Student All-Round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, Staff Well-Being and Development). The school was also recognised worldwide as an Apple Distinguished Programme (2015–2016) and subsequently as an Apple Distinguished School (2017–2018, 2019-2021) for innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

As the school moves into the next phase of development, it aims to provide more opportunities for students to further their unique talents and interests. To this end, the school embarked on interest-based development programmes for the Primary 3 level in 2020.

Principals:<br>
\- Ms Ratnasingam Selvarani (2000–2009)<br>
\- Mr Wong Poo Mun (2010–present)

This logo depicts the school as a modern outfit, forward looking in nature and bold in outlook. The 3 stylised calligraphic strokes depict the letter "C", "P" and "S", which are also the initials of the school. Facing the letter S is a sphere representing a globe. The globe represents the long-term goal of the school.
