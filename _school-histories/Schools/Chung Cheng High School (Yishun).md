#### **School History**
Chung Cheng High School started in 1939 as an all-boys school on Kim Yan Road. Guided by its philosophy of providing education to all without discrimination, the school admitted students from all strata of society. Students came from as far as Thailand and the Philippines. When the Japanese invaded Singapore, the school was forced to discontinue. After World War II, the school resumed in 1945 and subsequently took in female students.

The school achieved top honours in the first national examination in 1947. With rising enrolment, a 14-acre plot of land at Goodman Road was purchased for a new campus. Chung Cheng High School (Main) occupied the new campus, while the Kim Yan Road campus became home to Chung Cheng High School (Branch). In 1981, following Singapore’s emphasis on bilingualism, the school began providing English-stream classes. In the late 1990s, there was an urgent need to upgrade the school facilities and move to a more spacious location.

In January 2003, in preparation for its move to Yishun, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) began operating at two campuses: the Guillemard site and a holding school at Sembawang Drive. In 2005, when the new building in Yishun was completed, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) was renamed Chung Cheng High School (Yishun).&nbsp;On 30 June 2006, the school held its official opening ceremony at its new premises.

In 2014, Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) was one of the 11 pioneer schools offering the Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The school’s LLP aims to building sound character in the students by exposing them to traditional Chinese culture and values behind various arts forms. In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in food science and technology, which seeks to develop the students’ analytical, research, communications and interpersonal skills, thereby inspiring them to pursue a career in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) industry.&nbsp;

In 2014, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary together with Chung Cheng High School (Main).&nbsp;  
  
In&nbsp;2019, the school celebrated its&nbsp;80th anniversary together with Chung Cheng High School (Main).

Overlooking the eastern shore of Singapore,<br>
Gallantly stands the magnificent Chung Cheng of ours.<br>
Spreading far and wide our cultural heritage and traditions,<br>
Enriching it with the best of all great civilisations,<br>

With people of all countries.<br>
To eternity we perpetuate<br>
The aspirations of our magnificent Chung Cheng,<br>
Far beyond all boundaries.
