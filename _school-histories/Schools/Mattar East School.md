#### **School History**
Founded in 1963, Mattar East Primary School was located along Mattar Road, next to Mattar Primary School and Aljunied Primary School. All three schools shared a large field. Mattar East Primary School started with an intake of approximately 2300 students.   
  
In 1969, Mattar East Primary School won the National Netball Tournament. In the same year, its Folk Dance Group performed on the opening night of the Music and Dance Festival at the National Theatre and received the Certificate of Merit.   
  
Over time, Mattar East Primary School’s enrolment fell. By 1982, there were only 1275 students enrolled. The school merged with Mattar Primary School in 1988. In 1991, Mattar Primary School was closed down. Students of Mattar Primary School were provided alternative places in MacPherson Primary School. The former site of Mattar East Primary School was then used for MacPherson Primary School. In 2019, MacPherson Primary School merged with Cedar Primary School and shifted to the latter’s campus. Since 2020, the site has been used as a temporary location for St. Margaret's Primary School while upgrading works are in progress at the school’s site at Wilkie Road.
