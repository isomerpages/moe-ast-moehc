#### **School History**
Built in 1955, Jalan Kayu Primary School began operations in 1958. Class sizes were full when the school opened.  
  
From the early 1970s, the school's enrollment declined as residents moved to new towns, such as Ang Mo Kio. The school closed down in 1988. The remaining students and staff joined Ang Mo Kio Primary School in the same year.  
  
In the 1990s, the former site of the school was used to build the Tampines Expressway (TPE), which occupies the land till today.

Come, let us sing with one voice,<br>
Loud and strong<br>
Of the school that we love,<br>
Of the place where we belong,<br>
Jalan Kayu, Jalan Kayu, the school we love so well.<br>
Jalan Kayu, Jalan Kayu, the school we love so well.<br>
Where we learn honesty, diligence and loyalty.<br>
How to be neat and clean. And to work on cheerfully.<br>
Jalan Kayu, we’ll remember all the days we’ve spent with you.<br>
