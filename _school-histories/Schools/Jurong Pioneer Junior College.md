#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/jpjc1.png">

JPJC’s crest is the fusion of the letters ‘J’ and ‘P’ – the first letter of the names of its predecessors. It is a deliberate tribute to the legacy and values upon which JPJC was established: the unyielding dedication to the passion to learn and the spirit of seeking personal excellence.

The letters meld together to form the shape of an infinite loop, unceasing and limitless. The swirl connotes fluidity and flexibility, symbolising the students’ versatility in adapting to an ever-changing world.

The colours of the crest emanate passion for growth, learning and giving, while anchored by depth of thinking and steadfastness. Maroon radiates the intensity of passion and courage, representing strength and warmth. Dark blue symbolises intelligence and wisdom, while also exuding confidence and equanimity. The two colours intertwine to create a constant flow of JPJC’s ideals, mutually enhancing and empowering.

Different paths we had before,<br>
Now together we will soar.<br>
Boundless love,<br>
Endless growth.<br>
Serve with zest, open our doors.<br>
As dawn breaks, we rise up high.<br>
There’s no limit in the sky.<br>
Forward we go, we will grow.<br>
Hand in hand we light the trail.
  
While I Live, I Learn.<br>
In heart and mind, I’ll grow.<br>
With heart and voice, we venture.<br>
We’ll cross all new frontiers.<br>
In our hearts the flame ignites,<br>
_Plus Ultra_&nbsp;we set our sights.<br>
Brave the odds,<br>
Blaze the trail.<br>
JP always strives as one.

Brave the odds,<br>
Blaze the trail.<br>
JP always strives as one!
