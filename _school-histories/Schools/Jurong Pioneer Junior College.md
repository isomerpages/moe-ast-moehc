#### **School History**
Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) was established in 2019 through the merger of Jurong Junior College and Pioneer Junior College. It is currently located at 21 Teck Whye Walk. On 15 December 2018, Dr Hang Kim Hoo was appointed the college’s first principal.

Since its inception in 2019, JPJC has embarked on its mission to nurture active learners, innovative thinkers and compassionate leaders who have confidence for the future. This is done by providing an all-rounded education for its students through a suite of academic and co-curricular programmes drawn from the best offered by both parent colleges.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/jpjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

JPJC’s crest is the fusion of the letters ‘J’ and ‘P’ – the first letter of the names of its predecessors. It is a deliberate tribute to the legacy and values upon which JPJC was established: the unyielding dedication to the passion to learn and the spirit of seeking personal excellence.

The letters meld together to form the shape of an infinite loop, unceasing and limitless. The swirl connotes fluidity and flexibility, symbolising the students’ versatility in adapting to an ever-changing world.

The colours of the crest emanate passion for growth, learning and giving, while anchored by depth of thinking and steadfastness. Maroon radiates the intensity of passion and courage, representing strength and warmth. Dark blue symbolises intelligence and wisdom, while also exuding confidence and equanimity. The two colours intertwine to create a constant flow of JPJC’s ideals, mutually enhancing and empowering.

Different paths we had before,<br>
Now together we will soar.<br>
Boundless love,<br>
Endless growth.<br>
Serve with zest, open our doors.<br>
As dawn breaks, we rise up high.<br>
There’s no limit in the sky.<br>
Forward we go, we will grow.<br>
Hand in hand we light the trail.
  
While I Live, I Learn.<br>
In heart and mind, I’ll grow.<br>
With heart and voice, we venture.<br>
We’ll cross all new frontiers.<br>
In our hearts the flame ignites,<br>
_Plus Ultra_ we set our sights.<br>
Brave the odds,<br>
Blaze the trail.<br>
JP always strives as one.

Brave the odds,<br>
Blaze the trail.<br>
JP always strives as one!
