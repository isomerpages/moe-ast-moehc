#### **School History**
Stamford Primary School started in 1951 as Stamford Girls’ School. The original school building on Waterloo Street was first erected in 1920 by the Japan Club (now Japanese Association) as a school for the Japanese community in Singapore. The school remained an all-girls school for three decades until it merged with Waterloo School in 1984 and adopted its current name, Stamford Primary School.

On 18 March 1986, the school moved to its current premises at 1 Victoria Lane. In 1987, it merged with Selegie Primary School and the new school was officially opened on 15 September 1988. In 2002, the school completed PRIME upgrading and it became single-session the following year. A new indoor sports hall and a building with additional rooms and facilities were completed in 2017 under PERI upgrading.
