#### **School History**
Established in 1955, Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) started as Alexandra Estate Secondary School, a co-educational school at Prince Charles Crescent. In 1956, the boys were transferred to Pasir Panjang Secondary School, and Alexandra Estate Secondary School became known as CGS, a full-fledged all-girls school. Between 1990 to 1993, CGS moved out for rebuilding works. In 1994, the school returned to its original home, with new buildings and a new address, 357 Tanglin Road. Crescent celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2016.

In 1996, CGS was accorded autonomous status in recognition of its achievements in holistic education. The school continued to develop students beyond the classroom with new learning spaces like the Performing Arts Theatrette and the Arts Conservatory. In that decade, Crescent also reached out to other schools to offer their students various exciting learning opportunities in CGS’s roles as a Centre of Excellence in both the creative arts and information technology.

In 2007, CGS was selected as one of the pioneer FutureSchools@Singapore, blazing the trail in using technology for education and developing 21st-century competencies. That year, the school was internationally recognised as one of Microsoft’s first mentor schools. CGS continued to innovate in terms of using technology for teaching and learning, receiving the UNESCO – Intel School Award (Gold) in 2011.

Having garnered local and international recognition for being at the forefront of 21st-century student learning, CGS launched the Crescent Academy for Digital-Age Learning (CrADLe) in 2011 in the spirit of professional sharing with other schools that are keen to embrace 21st-century competencies and digital learning.

The school was awarded the School Distinction Award by the Ministry of Education in 2015, with recognised best practices in Teaching and Learning, Student All-Round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, Staff Well-being and Development, and Partnership.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gk7bedW2PKf0d6DAZl0r0EPSYt3scwc-/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a>

Oh, let us join our school to praise,<br>
Sing blithe and gay and free,<br>
Resolve to follow courteous ways,<br>
And ever truthful be.<br>
To study hard and play with zest,<br>
To always strive to do our best.<br>
Sincere in all our living<br>
And generous in our giving.

Our school colours yellow and blue,<br>
Mean ideals good and clean.<br>
The lotus emblem pure and true,<br>
Forever makes us keen.<br>
To cherish our Alma Mater,<br>
Now and forever later.<br>
Onward with zeal and zest,<br>
Forward we of CGS.

And though of diverse creeds we be,<br>
Together we must work.<br>
Without a trace of jealousy,<br>
Our aim is not to shirk.<br>
In Maths or Science or Geography,<br>
Or games which make us fit and free.<br>
The day when we must part,<br>
May Crescent remain in our hearts.
