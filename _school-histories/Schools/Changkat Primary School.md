#### **School History**
Changkat Primary School was established in January 1965 as Changkat Changi Primary School. Its name was derived from its location. The word changkat means “small hill” in Malay, and the school was built on top of a small hill on Changi Road.   
  
In 1988, the school moved to 11 Simei Street 3 and was renamed Changkat Primary School. In 2002, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, and returned to its original, new premises in June 2004.   
  
In 2009, the school became a single-session school.   
  
The school completed its PERI upgrading in June 2018, which saw the addition of an indoor sports hall and a new block that houses a student care center.
