#### **School Motto**
Strive for Excellence

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/jagohpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The School Crest shall consist of three components:

The central logo, formed by the initial ‘J’ for ‘JAGOH’ (meaning CHAMPION in Malay); the name of the school ‘JAGOH PRIMARY SCHOOL’ above it; the school motto, ‘STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE’ below it.

The logo, the name and the motto of the school shall be in blue against a white background.

The letter ‘J’ is laterally inverted, the resulting symmetry symbolizes balance and soundness in the school policy.

The upward pointing structure of the logo is symbolic of direction and drive in the educational pursuits and performance of the school.

The boldness of the ‘J’ signifies strength and steadfastness of character.

The colour blue represents loyalty and the colour white signifies moral integrity and virtue.
