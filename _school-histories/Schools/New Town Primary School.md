#### **School History**
New Town Primary School was established in 1965 as an integrated school, offering both English and Chinese classes in two sessions. The school, located in Queenstown at 402 Commonwealth Drive, served the needs of families in the first Housing and Development Board estate. The school was officially opened on 26 July 1965.

In 1983, New Town Primary School became an English-medium school. In 1992, the school moved to the premises of the former Permaisura Primary School at Commonwealth Drive. In 2004, New Town Primary School became single-session. In 2009, New Town Primary School merged with Ghim Moh Primary School and relocated to its current premises at 300 Tanglin Halt Road. In 2010, New Town Primary School celebrated its 45th anniversary and the new school campus was officially opened.

In 2015, New Town Primary School celebrated its 50th anniversary with a homecoming dinner on 31 July, in tandem with the nation’s SG50 celebrations.
