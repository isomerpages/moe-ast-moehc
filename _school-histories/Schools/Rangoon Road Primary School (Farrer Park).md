#### **School History**
Rangoon Road Primary School was established in 1968 when McNair School’s staff and pupils moved there, following the latter’s conversion into a workshop. Students from Tuan Mong Branch School’s Chinese stream were also integrated with the school’s English stream classes. Former Member of Parliament, Mr Lawrence Sia officially opened Rangoon Road Primary School on 28 May 1968.

In 1969, students from Chung Kuo School joined Rangoon Road Primary School’s Chinese stream. Additionally, demand for the school’s English stream continued to rise with greater residential shifts into the Toa Payoh estate.

From 1973 to 1983, the school also hosted French classes sponsored by the Ministry of Education and the French Embassy in Singapore. Secondary and pre-university students could learn French at the school’s French Language Centre.

In 1976, the Chinese stream was phased out due to falling enrolment rates. The school became a full English stream school, offering Chinese and Tamil as second languages.

Rangoon Road Primary School was closed in 1983. Since 1993, the school building has been home to the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Quek Hock Thiam (1968-1973)<br>
\- Mr Ling Kiong Bing (1973-1983)

In this school of ours in unity, we’ll strive to<br>
Bring her high honour in work and<br>

Spurring on the weaker to<br>
Win our goals.

Each here will meet his challenge with patience, truth and courage.<br>
A will and a way.<br>
A mind open and gay.<br>
You and I shall work, shall win.<br>
Live and learn! Live and learn.
