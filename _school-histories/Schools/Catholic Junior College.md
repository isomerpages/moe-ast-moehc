#### **School History**
The possibility of a Catholic junior college that provides a pre-university education for students from affiliated Catholic schools first took shape in 1971. The project was undertaken by the Archdiocese of Singapore, generously assisted by the Catholic bishops in Germany, the Singapore government and philanthropists. A piece of land on Whitley Road, which used to be a rubber plantation, was designated as the location of Catholic Junior College (CJC). The foundation stone was laid by Dr Lee Chiaw Meng, then Minister for Education, on 12 July 1974.

As the premises were not ready for occupation in January 1975, the pioneer students studied in St Joseph’s Institution, Montfort Secondary School, Catholic High School and the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus. In March 1975, 785 students moved to a completed wing of CJC. The school was officially opened on 26 June 1976 by Mr E.W. Barker, then Minister for Law and Environment, with Brother Patrick Loh appointed as the first principal.

Until the end of 1978, Chinese was also used as a medium of instruction in addition to English. The college admitted students in the technical stream until 1982. The commerce stream started in 1976. Upgrading of the school buildings and facilities to prepare students for the new millennium was completed in 2009.

Over the past 40 years, CJC has been recognised as an institution founded on the values of truth and love, with an emphasis on holistic education. Both academic excellence and a strong moral and social character remain hallmarks of the CJC student. The college is prepared for a changing global landscape, while staying steadfast to its values.  
  
Today, as the only Catholic Junior College in Singapore, CJC continues to grow as a vibrant, diverse community. Students strive to become thinkers with a mission, leaders with a heart. An alumnus of the college is known to be bold, articulate and always committed to leading and serving to make a positive impact in society.

#### **School Motto**
_In Veritate et Caritate_

The college motto is Latin for ‘In Truth and Love’. It implies seeking the truth about the universe, about oneself and about God. But truth alone is not sufficient; there must be love based on understanding and reason.

‘In Veritate et Caritate’ carries St Paul’s message, a call to love and live among the followers of Christ: “If we live by the truth and in love, we shall grow in all ways into Christ, who is the Head, by whom the whole body is fitted and joined together, every joint adding its own strength for each separate part to work according to its function, so the body grows until it has built itself up, in love.” (Ephesians 4:15–16).  
  
The college motto, **In Veritate et Caritate** ('In Truth and Love') speaks of our mission to nurture students who will be thinkers and leaders that uphold integrity, and are driven by the desire to serve and improve the world around them.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/catholicjc1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The principal symbol of CJC is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit of God, depicted by the dove, guides the college in every word, thought and deed. The Spirit helps keep Christ alive, symbolised by the cross, in the CJC community, so that one acts ‘In Truth and Love’, in and beyond the college. The college flame reinforces the idea that the light of God, knowledge and wisdom must lead the way. The crest, in the shape of a shield, depicts the armour needed to guard oneself from what is contrary to God’s ways. It is clad in gold to signify how the school treasures its Catholic identity and is a reminder of the pursuit of excellence in learning and living.

We are heirs of a glorious kingdom<br>
Of treasures past ages have bestowed<br>
