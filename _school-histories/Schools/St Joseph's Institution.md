#### **School History**
St Joseph’s Institution (SJI) is a Catholic school founded in 1852 by the Brothers of the Christian Schools, or the De La Salle Brothers. SJI was the first missionary establishment of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Southeast Asia. SJI owes its establishment to Reverend Father Jean-Marie Beurel, a French priest who was working in Singapore in the 1840s.

On 22 July 1852, St John’s School was established as a free school for boys on Bras Basah Road, which depended on the support of the public. As the enrolment of the school increased significantly, the school required expansion. The cornerstone of the new campus was subsequently laid on 19 March 1855 (Feast of St Joseph) and the school was renamed as St Joseph’s Institution.

In 1914, the student enrolment of SJI reached almost 1,200, compared with 426 in 1900. By 1922, the population had risen to 1,600. The Brothers foresaw the need for another school, and this led to the establishment of St Patrick’s school, another Lasallian school, in 1933.

During the Japanese Occupation, SJI was renamed as Bras Basah Road Boys’ School.

In 1972, SJI celebrated its 120th anniversary. Its pre-university classes were transferred to the newly established Catholic Junior College in 1975. The institution celebrated its 125th anniversary in 1977.

SJI became an independent school and moved from its iconic Bras Basah campus to a new campus on Malcolm Road in 1988. The institution celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2002.

In 2013, SJI began a dual-track education for secondary school boys with the four- year O-Level Programme and the six-year Integrated Programme that leads to the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IBDP). SJI also began admitting female students for post-secondary education under the two-year IBDP.

The SJI secondary education programme comprises three levels of learning: Academic Foundations, Academic Extensions and Academic Application. The institution has also developed a Religious and Moral Education programme and a robust Student Development Programme to nurture students in values, character and servant leadership.

In 2017, SJI returned to the redeveloped Malcolm Road campus from its temporary premises in Bishan after a three-year upgrading programme, and held a celebration dinner to commemorate its 165th anniversary on 22 July that year. The following year**,** SJI marked its 30th year as an independent school at Malcolm Road.  
  
In 2019, Lasallian schools worldwide celebrated the Tercentenary death anniversary of our Founder St John Baptist de La Salle. SJI commemorated this anniversary with the official opening of _Missio 1852_ on 7 August, an archive gallery that showcases the journey of SJI's humble beginnings as the first Catholic school in Singapore since 1852.

#### **School Motto**
Ora et Labora (Pray and Work)

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/stjosephinstitution1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is very important in reflecting the school’s common identity, as well as its underlying spirit of prayer and work (‘Ora et Labora’)'.

The current school crest was introduced in 1950 to replace an older version. It was designed by Mr Richard Walker, Art Supervisor of the Education Department.

The green field of the crest is divided into four quadrants by a white cross, the symbol of the Christian faith. In the centre of the cross lies the logo of the Brothers – a five-pointed star, the Signum Fidei (Sign of Faith). It has its origin as the Star of Bethlehem that led the Magi (wise men of the East) to the birth of Christ. In fact, ‘Signum Fidei’ is the motto of the Brothers of the Christian Schools founded by St John Baptist de La Salle. It reminds all students to centre their lives on faith and to always aspire towards the reachable star of their convictions and ideals.

In the top-left quadrant are three interlocking circles, symbolising games and the sporting spirit of all students. The top-right quadrant features the lamp of knowledge on a book, which symbolises learning. The lion in the bottom-left quadrant represents the courage and determination that students should embrace when they face the many challenges of life. It also reminds students that the flagship of the Lasallian enterprise in Asia was established in Singapura, or Lion City, in 1852. The bottom-right quadrant of the crest carries the monogram of the school.

The crown surmounting the crest symbolises the victory of faith over the forces of evil. It is also a reminder that the institution was founded in the days when Singapore was still a British colony. The Latin motto of the school, ‘Ora et Labora’ (Pray and Work), is inscribed on the scroll at the bottom of the crest.

The star, the lamp, the lion and the three interlocking circles also symbolise the four fraternities united as one community in the school.

**The School Rally**

All through our college, a voice is resounding<br>
Promptly respond to your duty’s sweet call<br>
Harken you all for the trumpet is sounding<br>
Your Mater’s proclaiming her watchword to all

Forward her children dear<br>
Ever with hearts sincere<br>
Render with joy to your Mater her due<br>
All that is vile reject heaven will e’er protect<br>
Sons of St Joseph’s valiant and true

Onward and upward in life’s earnest battle<br>
Joyously bearing the brunt of the fight<br>
Nobly forgiving, for all that may pain you<br>
And bravely defending the cause of the right

\[Chorus\]

"Ora et Labora" your motto still bearing<br>
Forward with courage in ways that are just<br>
True to your standard, be serving and daring<br>
As faithful Josephians, in heaven you trust

\[Chorus\]
