#### **School History**
Peiying Primary School, formerly known as Poi Eng Public School, is one of the oldest schools in Nee Soon. The history of Peiying can be traced back to 1919 when the famous philanthropist, Lim Nee Soon, set up Fa Chu School at Jalan Ulu Seletar. Fa Chu School later moved to Kangkar and was renamed Zang Hua School. In January 1941, the school merged with Qi Zhi School to form Poi Eng Public School, which was then located at Upper Thomson Road, next to the former Seletar Institute. Poi Eng Public School was supported by the local community and provided education to Chinese children in Nee Soon.

In 1987, Poi Eng Public School relocated to Yishun Ring Road, became a government school and was renamed Peiying Primary School. In Chinese, ‘Poi Eng’ or ‘Pei Ying’ means ‘to nurture citizens for nation-building’.

While waiting for the completion of the new school building on Yishun Ring Road, Peiying held classes at Chongfu Primary School for nine months. In 1988, the school moved to its current premises on Yishun Ring Road. From 2001 to 2003, Peiying Primary School underwent the PRIME upgrading. In 2018, the school completed PERI upgrading.

In 2014, Peiying Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Sports, Character Development and Adventure Learning Experiences @ Peiying (SCALE@PEIYING)’.   
  
The school subsequently implemented an Applied Learning Programme, Project THINK (Thinking Holistic Innovative Networked Kids) for Home Earth in 2019. Project THINK is focused on environment education and is designed to enable students to be ‘future-ready’.
