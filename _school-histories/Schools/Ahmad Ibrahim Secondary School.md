#### **School History**
Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary was founded in 1963. It was named after the late Encik Ahmad Ibrahim, the former minister for health and labour, who was also the assemblyman for Sembawang.

First located in Upper Thomson, the school moved to the current Yishun campus in 1985. Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary started out as an integrated school that offered two mediums of instruction, in English and Chinese. In 1987, in line with the national education policy, the school adopted English as the medium of instruction. The last batch of Chinese-educated students graduated in 1986.

A significant fact about the school’s history is that Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary was set up as an integrated school, with the primary aim of bringing students of different language streams together to study under one roof. The school was positioned with the key role of helping to promote racial cohesion in the early nation-building years. In today’s context, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary is still a microcosm truly reflective of the multi-ethnic, multicultural society of Singapore as it continues to be an institution that integrates students of different ethnicities and cultural backgrounds.

Another unique feature of the school is its integration of visually impaired students into mainstream education. In 1967, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary was the first pilot school for the open education programme for the blind. Today, the school continues to have visually impaired students studying together in the same class as all the other students.

Being named after Encik Ahmad Ibrahim serves as a reminder and an inspiration for our teachers and students to emulate his qualities of determination, courage, integrity and service. The school strives to live out these qualities through our core school values and programmes.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is ‘Character Development through Outdoor Learning Experience’. The LLP provides authentic real-world experiences for students to learn teamwork, build mental and emotional strength, as well as develop self and team leadership by taking on physical challenges. The programme also promotes environmental appreciation through outdoor activities.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is ‘Critical Social Inquiry and Media Literacy’, which seeks to raise students as critical thinkers and concerned citizens who care deeply about the community they live in, and who have the courage to lead and serve by taking action on the social causes they believe in.

Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary is one of four schools in Singapore offering the Enhanced Music Programme. Students with musical talent are given the opportunity to pursue music as an O-Level subject and to experience a wide array of enrichment activities ranging from concerts to masterclasses and mentorship. The school also offers an equivalent music preparatory course at the lower secondary level.

Through the three signature programmes, Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary aims to raise the social and cultural capital of students, as well as to grow students with character, nurture inquiry and discipline minds, and inspire courage to lead and serve.

#### **School Motto**
With Integrity and Compassion

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/ahmadibrahimsec1.jpg">

<br>The torch with its red glowing flame symbolises the light of integrity and the warmth of compassion. It inspires every student to bear the truth, stand up for righteousness and, at the same time, have a heart for others and serve those in need.

The twirling background design together with the torch is a stylised depiction of the lowercase letters, ‘ai’, the abbreviated form of the school name, Ahmad Ibrahim, in lowercase.

The green colour shows the school’s shared value of harmony in a multiracial, multireligious school, while the silver colour represents its perseverance in the pursuit of excellence.

Ignited with passion to learn and care<br>
Growing together with all I share
