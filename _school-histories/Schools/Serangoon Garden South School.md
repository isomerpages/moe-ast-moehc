#### **School History**
Serangoon Garden South School was established in 1955. It initially functioned at Sennett Estate Primary School, and moved to its own building after a few months. Most of the students in the early years were from the farming and gardening community living on the fringe of the estate.

In 1963, Serangoon Garden South School had the honour of a visit by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The students put up a historical pageant for him, with various characters depicting 150 years of Singapore’s history.

In 1971, the school celebrated the opening of a new extension to its school library. The new extension included an AVA room, which the school used for viewing film-strips, as well as for musical appreciation classes, story-telling sessions and music lessons. In the same year, the school held a Variety Concert at the Victoria Theatre on 29 October 1971.

In 1984, Serangoon Garden South School celebrated the opening of the school’s aviary, which was built in the shape of a giagantic dome. Some of the birds were donated by the Jurong Bird Park.

The school celebrated its 25th anniversary in conjunction with the opening of the school hall and science block in 1980.

In 1988, Serangoon Garden North Primary merged with Serangoon Garden South School and became a single-session school.

In January 2007, Serangoon Garden South School merged with Zhonghua Primary School.
