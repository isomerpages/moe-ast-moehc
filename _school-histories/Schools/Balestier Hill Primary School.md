#### **School History**
Balestier Hill Primary School (BHPS) was established in January 2002 following the merger of Moulmein Primary School and Swiss Cottage Primary School.  
  
The school leveraged both innovation and environmental education to provide a vibrant learning environment for the students. Students were involved in developing innovative and entrepreneurial projects to develop an aptitude for innovation. In 2003, the school linked a nanotechnology programme with life sciences and successfully hybridised the orchid, Doritis Pulcherrima ‘Balestier United’. Since 2007, the school has been receiving the Lotus Sustained Achievement Award by the Singapore Environmental Council in recognition of BHPS’s green efforts. To show the importance of a green living environment and reduced carbon footprints, the school initiated a Grow-Up-with-a-Tree programme where the school leaders planted a fruit tree with every Primary One cohort from 2013.   
  
In 2012, BHPS was the proud recipient of the Developmental Awards for both Character Development and National Education. This success attests to the school’s commitment to advancing character and citizenship education.  
  
The year 2014 marked another very significant milestone in the school’s history. It embarked on a re-envisioning journey, which saw the articulation of the current vision, mission and a new set of school values.    
  
Recognising the students’ sports talent, track and field was identified as a school-based sports niche in 2002. As the school grew from strength to strength in sports and environmental education, BHPS successfully implemented its Learning for Life Programme known as The ALTOS Experience @ BHPS in 2015. This programme aimed to develop students into life-long learners equipped with 21st-century competencies through various sports and outdoor activities.  
  
Progressing with the times, information and communications technology was harnessed to develop students’ 21st-century competencies and skills to prepare them to be future-ready. Coding and robotics were introduced within curriculum time to develop creative problem-solving and collaborative skills.   
  
In 2019, BHPS merged with Bendemeer Primary School to become the new Bendemeer Primary School.  

Principals:<br>
\- Dr Irene Ho (2002–2011)<br>
\- Ms Tan Chay Eng (2012–2018)
