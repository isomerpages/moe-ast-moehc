#### **School History**
Hong Kah Secondary School was established in 1994 at 931 Jurong West Street 42 as a single-session government co-educational school. It was officially opened on 28 June 1996. The following year, the school became double-session. In 2000, the school reverted to being single-session. In 2009, the school completed PRIME upgrading.

Hong Kah’s Applied Learning Programme, ‘Real-world Learning through Electronics’, started in 2015. It seeks to develop students into budding, community-spirited engineers. All lower-secondary students learn the basics of electronics during Project Work lessons. Those with a strong interest and aptitude for electronics can opt to study electronics as an O-Level Applied Subject, or smart electrical technology as a Normal (Technical) Applied Subject.

Implemented in 2016, Hong Kah’s Learning for Life Programme aims to develop active youths with the knowledge, skills and competencies required to lead and promote a healthy lifestyle. Known as ‘Sports, Active Living and Values Education’ (Sports A.L.I.V.E!), the programme allows every student to be developed at a pace that is most suited to his or her interest level, abilities and aptitude. For example, at the Tier 1 level, existing school programmes such as physical education, co-curricular activities and character development programmes are tweaked and fine-tuned to engage all students to develop a lifelong interest in sports and a healthy lifestyle.

In 2019, Hong Kah Secondary School merged with Jurongville Secondary School to form the new Jurongville Secondary School. The merged school operates from the premises of Jurongville Secondary School.

#### **School Motto**
Conquer Thyself

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/hongkahsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest represents the school’s philosophy and its commitment to the students’ education. The circular shape reflects the aim of the school to provide a well-rounded education for every Hong Kah student. The three stars represent the three participants in the education enterprise: parents, students and professionals. Each has an important role to play, but the brightest star is the student. The globe signifies the internationalised outlook of the new world-ready youths.

The Chinese characters are a reminder that while students move forward in the name of change, they must not forget the richness of their past. The Hong Kah colours of blue, green and gold symbolise respectively the infinite opportunities to reach for the stars; nature, life and a caring environment; and the ultimate achievement of the star, the invaluable qualities of education.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

A life is given to each one of us<br>
To make this a better world<br>
Our life in Hong Kah we shall treasure<br>
In Hong Kah our true-self we discover. 

Conquer our shadows, fears and tears<br>
We are blessed with many a strength. <br>
Wisely we shall tend and use them<br>
The world is in our hands.

Hong Kah, Hong Kah<br>
We learn from thee<br>
We give to thee<br>
Help us shine of good mind<br>
Help us care with a heart that's ever kind. 

Firmly nudge our Hong Kah boys<br>
Gently urge our Hong Kah girls<br>
Our future to us beckons<br>
With pride, joy and confidence.

Conquer thyself, conquer thyself<br>
We learn from thee<br>
We give to thee<br>
Together, together we grow.
