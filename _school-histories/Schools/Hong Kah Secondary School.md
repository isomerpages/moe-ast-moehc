#### **School History**
Hong Kah Secondary School was established in 1994 at 931 Jurong West Street 42 as a single-session government co-educational school. It was officially opened on 28 June 1996. The following year, the school became double-session. In 2000, the school reverted to being single-session. In 2009, the school completed PRIME upgrading.

Hong Kah’s Applied Learning Programme, ‘Real-world Learning through Electronics’, started in 2015. It seeks to develop students into budding, community-spirited engineers. All lower-secondary students learn the basics of electronics during Project Work lessons. Those with a strong interest and aptitude for electronics can opt to study electronics as an O-Level Applied Subject, or smart electrical technology as a Normal (Technical) Applied Subject.

Implemented in 2016, Hong Kah’s Learning for Life Programme aims to develop active youths with the knowledge, skills and competencies required to lead and promote a healthy lifestyle. Known as ‘Sports, Active Living and Values Education’ (Sports A.L.I.V.E!), the programme allows every student to be developed at a pace that is most suited to his or her interest level, abilities and aptitude. For example, at the Tier 1 level, existing school programmes such as physical education, co-curricular activities and character development programmes are tweaked and fine-tuned to engage all students to develop a lifelong interest in sports and a healthy lifestyle.

In 2019, Hong Kah Secondary School merged with Jurongville Secondary School to form the new Jurongville Secondary School. The merged school operates from the premises of Jurongville Secondary School.
