#### **School History**
Boon Lay Garden Primary School (BLGPS) was established in 1977 along Boon Lay Avenue. The government built the school to meet the increasing demand for school places by residents of the Boon Lay constituency. Officially declared open on 18 August 1978, the school started with an enrolment of 1,080 pupils in 20 English-stream and seven Chinese-stream classes. The school relocated to its present premises at Boon Lay Drive in December 2001. The new campus was officially opened on 31 July 2004.&nbsp;  
  
The mission of Boon Lay Garden Primary has always been to provide a nurturing and supportive learning environment where pupils are developed to their fullest potential, with a readiness to serve others. Over the years, the school has built an indoor sports hall, an outdoor experiential learning space, a fitness playground and a student care centre to better support its teaching and learning programmes.&nbsp;  
  
Boon Lay Garden Primary celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017 and completed its PERI upgrading in 2018.

The school Crest comprises the school principal colours of brown and white, a central, yellow motif, an open book atop the logo, and the overarching school motto. Each symbolizes a hallmark of Boon Lay Garden Primary School:

*   The principal colours of brown and white represent a balanced approach in educating students through academic and aesthetic programmes- brown emphasizes the need to be grounded; white the clarity in thought for every educational endeavour.
*   The gear is a symbol of industry- a desirable quality for all. It signifies a concerted effort to bring out the best in every child- expressed in values, knowledge and skills; the colour yellow a symbol of the children’s radiant aspirations.
*   The book on top reiterates the importance of providing quality education for every child that passes through the school gates.
