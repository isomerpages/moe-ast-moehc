#### **School History**
On 21 March 1919, the Singapore Nanyang Overseas Middle School was founded by Mr Tan Kah Kee to provide a four-year secondary-level education. Located in a rented bungalow off Niven Road, it was the first high school in Southeast Asia to cater to different dialect groups among overseas Chinese in the region. In 1925, the school moved to a new campus at Bukit Timah Road, and it was officially renamed The Chinese High School.

After Singapore gained independence in 1965, the school came under the purview of the Ministry of Education. In 1979, the school was accorded the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) status. In 1987, it acquired the Independent School status. In 1993, The Chinese High School introduced the Gifted Education Programme to offer enriched opportunities to students to fulfill their academic potential, especially in Mathematics and Science. In 1994, the new Enhanced Pupil Performance Programme was established to encourage the spirit of independence and to give students the freedom to form any club or society of their choice.

The school’s clock tower was gazetted as a national monument on 19 March 1999.

On 1 January 2005, The Chinese High School merged with Hwa Chong Junior College to form the integrated Hwa Chong Institution to facilitate the running of the school’s Integrated Programme. The new institution retains the Chinese name and crest of the Chinese High School.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/thechihighsch1.jpg">

In 1930, Chinese High’s new triangular-shaped crest reflects the harmonious three-way link between the school’s board members, teachers and students. The&nbsp;**feather**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**hammer**&nbsp;together mean being master of both the pen and the sword. The&nbsp;**torch**&nbsp;represents a burning passion for learning that will never be extinguished.

海天寥廓 云树苍笼 中有我华中<br>
礼门义路&nbsp;时雨春风&nbsp;吾侪托帡幪<br>
猗与华中&nbsp;南方之强&nbsp;我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆

人生茫茫 学海洋洋 吾侪当自强<br>
朝乾夕惕&nbsp;日就月将&nbsp;莫负好时光<br>
猗与华中&nbsp;南方之强&nbsp;我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆

迨予庶士 笃实辉光 斐然已成章<br>
膂力方刚 经营四方 前途浩且长<br>
猗与华中&nbsp;南方之强&nbsp;我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆
