#### **School History**
Established in 1980, Bedok South Secondary School (BDS) used to share premises with Temasek Secondary School and Kong San Primary School in Bedok South. The school moved into its present premises at 1 Jalan Langgar Bedok on 27 December 2002. The new campus was officially opened on 21 February 2004.

In 2014, BDS started its Applied Learning Programme, ‘PROJECT S.H.I.N.E.’ (An Integrated **S**tudent-Centred and **H**olistic programme that develops **I**nnovation and **N**urtures Empathy). In the programme, BDSians’ learning is maximised to help them become motivated learners who are able to work in teams or independently, to experiment with ideas, explore their talents and contribute to the community. Through the programme, the school seeks to involve students to work on generating solutions to real-world problems. 

In 2015, Bedok South Secondary School started its Learning for Life Programme, ‘SHAPE @BDS’ (A **S**chool of **H**ealthy **A**nd **P**hysically Educated **E**nthusiasts). Through sports and the outdoors, the programme aims to inculcate in students lifelong values, skills and competencies to lead themselves and others towards living an active, healthy and fulfilling life.
