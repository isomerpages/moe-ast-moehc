#### **School History**
Established in 1933, Pei Chun Public School was started as a Chinese-medium school by a group of Hainanese merchants who wanted to provide education for the children of the Chinese working class. As the only school in Singapore bearing the word ‘Public’, the school name clearly signifies the intent of its founders – a school started by the community for the community.

The first school building was a shophouse along Tanglin Road. The school moved to Orchard Road in 1935. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, the school stopped functioning in 1941 and only restarted its operations in an old bungalow on Anderson Road in 1946. The school then moved to Balmoral Road in 1947 and became a government-aided school in 1956. In 1970, the school started its operations at Toa Payoh Lorong 6.

With its unique Chinese culture and rich tradition as a Chinese-medium school in its early days, the school was accorded the Special Assistance Plan status in 1990. Through the years, the school prides itself on providing a bilingual and holistic education.

After the completion of PRIME upgrading in 2001, the school moved to its present location at Toa Payoh Lorong 7. The school was selected to be the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Chinese Language in 2005 and the South Zone Centre of Excellence for Sports in 2007.

From 2017 to 2019,&nbsp;the school&nbsp;undergone the PERI upgrading so as to better support the holistic development of its students. In 2018, the school celebrated its 85th anniversary&nbsp;at the holding site, at 580 Toa Payoh East. The school&nbsp;returned&nbsp;to Toa Payoh Lorong 7 in 2019 and became a single-session school in 2020.
