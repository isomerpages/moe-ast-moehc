#### **School History**
  
The rich heritage of our school began in 1924 as Geylang Methodist Girls’ School (GMGS) with the support of the Methodist Church in Singapore, Reverend Floyd Herman Sullivan and Miss Emma Eaton Walker.&nbsp; With a pupil enrolment of 27 girls, lessons were conducted in the sanctuary of Geylang Chinese Methodist Church (GCMC). Mrs Chia Han Kiat was the only teacher at that time.

The school stopped using the church premises after the land was acquired for development. During the redevelopment of GCMC, a portion of the land was allocated for the building of the school. It was equipped with new classrooms and other school amenities to cater to a growing enrolment. The enrolment had increased to 300 girls by 1930, with only the primary level.

During World War II, the school ceased operations and was used as barracks by Japanese soldiers. When the war ended, the school reopened in 1946 with double sessions to cater to the backlog of students who stopped schooling during the war. In 1949, the school became a government-aided school. The following year, it started the secondary level and became a full school. The first batch of students took their Cambridge Examinations in 1954.

In the 1970s, the school built an extension block with eight new classrooms, a school hall, a science laboratory and a home economics room. As the school’s identity became more defined, the school song was composed in 1975.

In 1984, GMGS was relocated and became two schools: Geylang Methodist Primary School and Geylang Methodist Secondary School. The schools became co-educational as they began taking in boys. Methodist Chinese School, which had been sharing the premises of GMGS in the afternoon for 48 years, shut down. Its 900 students were absorbed by the two schools.

In preparation for its conversion to a single-session school, the school building was upgraded in 1998. In the following year, the school became single-session with 38 classes for 1,500 students and a staff strength of 69.

The year 2007 marked two milestones for the schools. They were renamed Geylang Methodist School (Primary) and Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) to signify unity of the two schools. In addition, the school premises were upgraded with new and improved facilities. These included computer laboratories, media resource libraries, pastoral care rooms as well as health and fitness rooms. The blocks were linked via corridors and covered linkways, which made the school a more accessible place for all.

In 2024, the school commemorated its 100th anniversary (GM100) with the opening of its heritage museum – The Living Gallery. The gallery was designed to celebrate, document and share the remarkable 100-year heritage of Geylang Methodist Schools, its origination, journey, and commitment as a Methodist mission school, and how it continues to give back to the community in which it is deeply rooted.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/geylangmethodistsec1.jpg">

The school crest is the embodiment of the aims and aspirations of the Geylang Methodist Schools (GMS). The shield offers protection and is a reminder of God. Enshrined in the heart of the shield is a flaming torch formed by the letters ‘M’ and ‘S’. This symbolises the passion of GMS to seek the light and truth. The white 27-point starburst is inspired by the school’s heritage – when it started with 27 pupils in 1924. It is an inspiration to continuously strive for pure brilliance and ingenuity grounded in its education.

The colours blue and gold frame the crest, and represent heaven and earth respectively, reflecting heavenly aspirations that are firmly grounded in the earthly realism to ‘Grow in Friendship, Body and Mind’.

#### **School Song**

In Geylang Methodist we strive<br>
To grow in friendship, body, mind<br>
And never fail to keep alive<br>
The Truths of God which guide mankind.

With grateful hearts we sing the praise,<br>
Of Geylang Methodist today<br>
And to her glory now we raise<br>
Our pledge of loyalty for aye

When from each other we must part<br>
And cares of life around us press<br>
One thing will live within each heart<br>
The memory of G.M.S
