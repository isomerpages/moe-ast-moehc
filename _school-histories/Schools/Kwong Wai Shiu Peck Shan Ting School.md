#### **School History**
Established in 1936, Kwong Wai Shiu Peck Shan Ting Free School was founded by the Cantonese clan association Kwong Wai Shiu Peck Shan Ting. It aimed to provide free education for children from nearby villages without access to school. The school started with an enrolment of 40 students and one teacher. As the school grew in popularity, an additional classroom was built in the temple premises of the clan association to accommodate 60 students.  
  
During WWII, the school stopped operating. However, it opened soon after the war ended. The school saw its enrolment numbers increase rapidly in the following decade. Hence, a new school building was constructed at Upper Thomson Road to accommodate the growing student population. The school was renamed Kwong Wai Shiu Peck Shan Ting School in 1956. It became a government-aided school one year later.  
  
Eventually, enrolment declined at Kwong Wai Shiu Peck Shan Ting School, due to the growing demand for English-stream schools and when residents shifted from kampungs to Housing Development Board (HDB) flats. The school closed in 1981.  
  
Between 1983 and 1989, Bishan Estate was built on the school's former site.

Principals:
\- Mr Kwok Ming (1967-1981)
