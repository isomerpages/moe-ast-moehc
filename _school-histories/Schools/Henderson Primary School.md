#### **School Song**
We have gathered from far and near<br>
To strive, to seek and to persevere<br>
In our classrooms must all excel<br>
In sports and games we must do well.

**Chorus:**<br>
O Henderson we shall always be<br>
United as a family<br>
O Henderson we shall all strive<br>
To live by honour all our lives<br>
Let us gladly join our heart and hand<br>
Let’s strive to make our time at school well spent<br>
That we may improve each coming year<br>
That’s certain comrades never fear.

Let us all work in harmony<br>
We’ll play our part for our community<br>
Labour with our hands with dignity<br>
Help build our Lion City.
