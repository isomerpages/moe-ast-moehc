#### **School Song**
Music and Lyrics by Tan Keng Kang

Let’s sing a rousing song of praise<br>
In honour of our Ghim Moh Secondary School<br>
Let’s love our school just as our home<br>
And show our loyalty to the full.

We strive to reach the highest goal<br>
In all we do at work and play<br>
We'll give our best to heed the call<br>
Of bouden duty every day.

**Chorus**<br>
Persevere, persevere, persevere till the end<br>
We’ll strive and strive with might and main<br>
With our sustained effort there’ll be success<br>
If we fail we’ll strive and find success again.

Our aim is high, our heart is stout<br>
Our purpose clear – success to find<br>
All obstacles that cross our way<br>
We can overcome with steadfast mind.

The best in life is yet to come<br>
We’ll march on, press on, with no fear<br>
Be mindful of our guiding rule –<br>
Our motto: Strive and Persevere.
