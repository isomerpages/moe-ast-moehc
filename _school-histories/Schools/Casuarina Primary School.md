#### **School History**
Casuarina Primary School began operations on 2 January 2001 at the premises of Coral Primary School, with 97 students in three classes. The school moved to its current premises at Pasir Ris Street 41 in the following year. In July 2004, the school celebrated its official opening.

The school’s 10th anniversary in 2011 was celebrated with Homecoming@CAPS, during which staff, parents and students of past and present reconnected. In 2013, the Ministry of Education recognised the school’s niche in aesthetics for its programme, ‘HEARTS@CAPS’, which subsequently became its Learning for Life Programme.

In 2015, construction work started on the building of an indoor sports hall. In the following year, Casuarina Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘The Art of Language’, which supported the school’s holistic approach to nurturing students who are confident and effective communicators through the literary arts.

The school’s 15th anniversary in 2016 was themed ‘Casuarina Stories – Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow’, which celebrated its progress and past achievements as well as the strengthening of its current programmes so as to welcome the exciting future. 

In 2019, Casuarina Primary School merged with Loyang Primary School, taking on the Casuarina name and operated from its site. The new school encompasses the identities, strengths and cherished distinctiveness of both schools. A new school crest was designed, combining elements of both schools in terms of their identity and heritage. The new school uniform also signifies the creation of a new identity to unite Casuarina Primary students for a new beginning.

Principals:<br>
\- Ms Debra Saw (2001–2007)<br>
\- Mdm Norliza A. Rahim (2008–2014)<br>
\- Ms Albuquerque Karen Anne (2015–2018)<br>

#### **School Motto**
Be the Best We Can Be

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/casuarinapri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The combination of the ascending trees and the book symbolise progress, both forward and upward, to greater heights of success. **The trees symbolise strength of character. The colour green represents continuous growth, energy and vitality.** The turning of the page reflects the continuous acquisition of knowledge and skills needed to face the many challenges in life.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

At Casuarina Primary<br>
We learn and grow<br>
Our horizons do broaden<br>
our potential overflows<br>
Although we’re young<br>
We dare to dream<br>
Striving to be<br>
The best that we can be

_Overcoming every obstacle_<br>
_Reaching for the sky_<br>
_With courage to pursue our dreams_<br>
_At Casuarina Primary_<br>
_We will soar to greater heights_

With courage of heart<br>
And strength of will<br>
We will never give up<br>
The dreams that we have built<br>
Ever ready<br>
To help one another<br>
Thinking not just for ourselves<br>
But caring also for others<br>
(Chorus)
