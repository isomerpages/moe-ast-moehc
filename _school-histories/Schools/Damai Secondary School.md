#### **School History**
Established in 1993, Damai Secondary School (DSS) is a government co-educational school located at 4800 Bedok Reservoir Road. The school premises underwent PRIME upgrading from 2002 to 2004.

DSS had its fledgling start when it was officially handed over to the first principal on 16 October 1993. Located amidst lush surroundings in the heart of Bedok Reservoir, the school’s location and unique features reinforce the meaning of ‘Damai’ – Malay for ‘peace and serenity’. Its students, known as Damaians, proudly upheld the school motto, ‘Faith, Hope and Charity’.

DSS actively engaged the community to preserve and promote its heritage by establishing the National Education Garden and the Harmony Room, a national education resource centre. Visitors from local and overseas schools can view the exhibits on display and play with the traditional games and instruments available in the space.&nbsp;

Furthermore, the school worked extensively with communities and organisations to provide numerous platforms for its students to serve the community. &nbsp;DSS signed a five-year memorandum of understanding with the Muscular Dystrophy Association of Singapore as a long-term commitment to give back to the community. Through a collaboration with the National Kidney Foundation, the school also raised awareness on the prevention of renal diseases. In addition, Damaians extended their services to the Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapura and elderly homes such as St John’s Home. Working tirelessly to raise environmental awareness, Damaians were actively involved in the clean-up of Kallang Waterways and in maintaining the cleanliness of Bedok Reservoir Park, so that the community can enjoy the clean waterways and park.

In 2018, DSS and Bedok North Secondary School amalgamated, with the merged school operating from the premises of DSS and retaining the name of DSS. Sharing a combined history of 60 years, the merged school encompasses the identities, strengths and distinctiveness of both schools.&nbsp;

Guided by its philosophy, ‘A Purposeful and Meaningful Life’,&nbsp;the year 2018 saw the new school forging ahead in unity to create a new identity for itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

The school crest signifies the merger of the two schools in 2018. It comprises a blazing beacon consisting of three digits of a hand (representing Bedok North Secondary School) and two letters, ‘DS’ (representing Damai Secondary School). The three digits also symbolise the school motto, ‘Aspire, Explore and Achieve’. The beacon represents the school’s commitment to serve as a guiding light to students and brighten their paths by helping them create a purposeful and meaningful life.&nbsp; This is achieved by leading students to acquire sound moral values, discover their interests and talents, and do their best.
