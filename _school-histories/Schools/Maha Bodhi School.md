#### **School History**
Rev Chee Hong of Leng Feng Bodhi Institute established Maha Bodhi School with a group of Buddhists in 1946 in a shophouse at Geylang Road. On 12 January 1948, the school was officially opened.

In 1951, Maha Bodhi School moved from the shophouse to a new school building at 50 Lorong 34, Geylang. In 1957, the school became a government-aided school. In 1966, the School Management Committee – led by Rev Hong Choon, Chairman of the Singapore Buddhist Federation – raised funds to extend the school building. This extension was officially declared opened in 1970, and the school became an integrated school, offering classes in both English and Chinese streams.

In 1985, Maha Bodhi School became a full English-medium school. In 1990, the school acquired Special Assistance Plan status, which emphasised the learning of both English and Chinese and the inculcation of Asian moral values in the students.

In 1991, the Singapore Buddhist Federation under the chairmanship of Ven Sek Yiu Torn, undertook the construction of a new building at Ubi Avenue 1 to provide students with up-to-date facilities in a conducive learning environment. In 1995, Maha Bodhi School relocated to its present premises at Ubi Avenue 1.

#### **School Motto**
敦品励学 Steadfast in Character. Thirst for Knowledge.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/mahabodhisch1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

‘Bodhi’ means enlightenment. Lord Buddha taught the world the truth and the ways to achieve enlightenment. ‘Maha’ means grand.

<br clear="left">

The school is named ‘Maha Bodhi’ because it aspires that all students of the school take up the character and moral of Lord Buddha; to emulate his examples as they absorb knowledge, wisdom and scientific techniques of the world; to live morally, truthfully and wisely.
