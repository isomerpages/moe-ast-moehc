#### **School History**
St. Thomas secondary school was established in 1955 by the Mar Thoma Syrian Church in Singapore. The school was located at Mar Thoma Road and was part of the church premises. In the early days, St. Thomas secondary school provided education for students whom were unable to continue their education in other schools for various reasons.  Since then, the school had changed in status, enrolment and size.

In 1972, St Thomas secondary school became a government-aided school. With this change, the school started to receive students from Ministry of Education (MOE).  After 27 years, the school moved from its premises at Mar Thoma Road to Telok Blangah in 1982. In total, the school had 721 students in 20 classes, both morning and afternoon sessions. There were 30 teachers and nine non-teaching staff.

In 1988, the students organised a charity Walkathon where the raised amount was used to improve the school’s learning facilities. By 1989, the student enrolment increased to 1,555 with 69 teachers and 17 non-teaching staff. This period also saw the change from Prefectorial System to the Student Council System so that more student leaders can be nurtured with leadership skills to serve the school.

Over the years, students from St Thomas secondary school actively participated in activities organised by uniformed groups, games and societies. Soccer, volleyball, the athletics club and the lion dance troupe were popular options among the students. New extra-curricular activities such as rugby, gymnastics and the choir were added in 1989.

St. Thomas secondary school was closed in 2000.

In days of old apostles went<br>
To teach all nations they were sent<br>
They followed their unfailing guide<br>
And preached the gospel far and wide.<br>
