#### **School History**
Named after Tampines New Town, Tampines Secondary School was established in 1986. It was one of the first schools built in the town. On 2 January 1986, the founding principal, Mr Koh Sei Hian, together with 12 teachers, welcomed the school’s inaugural 458 students. On 8 August 1988, the school was officially opened.

In the 1990s, the school underwent infrastructural upgrading to stay relevant in the age of growing information technologies, as well as to prepare for the transition to single-session in 2000. In 2008, Tampines Secondary School underwent PRIME upgrading.&nbsp;

Tampines Secondary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Creative Expressions: Character Development through Visual and Performing Arts’, and the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Creative Engineering: Inter-disciplinary Authentic Problem Solving’, in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

In 2016, the school celebrated its 30th anniversary.
