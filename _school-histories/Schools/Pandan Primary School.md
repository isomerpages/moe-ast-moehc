#### **School History**
Pandan Primary School was the first primary school to be built in Ayer Rajah. It was established on 2 January 1981 with approximately 1,900 students. Located at 700 West Coast Road, it was officially declared open on 16 July 1982.

In addition to their academic subjects, the students at Pandan Primary also had environmental education, which taught them to take ownership of the environment around them, such as by being “litter free” and by cultivating habits to reduce waste and to recycle used items. Pandan Primary School also published their own monthly newsletter, _Pandan News_.

The school had a robust IT education programme, which engaged both staff and students in a broad range of IT-related workshops and competitions, such as in Basic Robotics, movie-making and video-editing, and webpage construction. In 2000, the school participated in the National Junior Robotics Competition at the Singapore Science Centre, and one of the teams, “IT Challenger”, clinched second prize in the “Best Robot Performance” category.

In 2003, the school underwent renovations to improve the infrastructure.

In 2008, Pandan Primary School merged with Fuhua Primary School.

#### **School Motto**
Persevere, Progress and Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/pandanpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The **reversed P** on the left and a normal P on the right in a continous form to substantiate that education is a linked and continuous process. The two Ps also stand for both “Pandan Primary” as well as “Persevere and Progress”.

The **globular letter S** in the central uppermost position between the two Ps signifies that the World is ours to serve. It also means “school” and “serve”.

The banner with the school’s **motto** “Persevere, Progress and Serve” underlines the commitment that all work once begun must be completed.

The **anchor** indicates that an all-round education will anchor us safely in the habour of life.

The letter **S** and the two **Ps** combined make up a human figure. It symbolises the uprightness of a steadfast man behaving in a humbale and courteous Oreintal way, never forgetting his roots, culture or creed.

**Brown** and **beige** are the school colours. Brown, the colour of Earth, signifies a down-to-earth nature and practical traits. Beige signifies antiquity thus summing up that all good traits must forever be perpetuated.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We’re here for a purpose<br>
Our aims to fulfil<br>
We’ll get what we deserve<br>
With steadfastness of will.

**Chorus:**<br>
Pandan Primary, Pandan Primary<br>
We’ll work and serve with loyalty<br>
And live in peace and harmony.

We’ll do our very best<br>
To strive for our progress<br>
We’ll seek to honorably serve<br>
Our brothers and sisters.
