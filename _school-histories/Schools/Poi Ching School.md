#### **School History**
Poi Ching School was founded in 1919 by the late Reverend Kwok Koh Mou (郭可模) as a Chinese-medium school on Victoria Street. In 1924, due to financial difficulties, the Futsing Association took over the management of the school and relocated the school from Victoria Street to its office on Queen Street.

In 1958, the school became a government-aided school. In 1970, Poi Ching School moved from Queen Street to Toa Payoh. In 1992, the school was selected as a Special Assistance Plan school by the Ministry of Education to offer English and Chinese as first languages.

In 2000, Poi Ching School moved from Toa Payoh to its present premises at Tampines Street 71. In 2008, the school started its Bi-Cultural Programme. In 2014, the school completed the PERI upgrading, which saw the construction of a new seven-storey teaching block. In 2015, Poi Ching School became single-session and a Student Care Centre was set up to cater to the needs of working parents.

In 2016, Poi Ching School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘D’ARTS@PCS’.  
  
In 2020, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme – BEST Programme (Developing a Bilingual, Effective Speaker and WriTer in every PCS Student). The school celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2020.
