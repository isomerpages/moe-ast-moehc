#### **School History**
Queensway Secondary School was established in 1961 at 2A Margaret Drive and was officially opened on 2 September 1961. In 1967, Mrs K.S. Quah, a senior assistant of the school penned the lyrics to the school song, while the music was composed by Mr H.S. Chuang, the music teacher.&nbsp;

The development of the school was closely linked to the growth of Queenstown. By 1963, the school had 1,418 students and a teaching staff of 50. The school had morning and afternoon sessions. To cope with the increasing student enrolment, two new classroom blocks and an audiovisual theatre were constructed. By then, the school population had increased to 2,000.

The school merged with Mei Chin Secondary School in 2000, and with Buona Vista Secondary School in the following year after its completion of PRIME upgrading. Dr Ng Eng Hen, then Minister of State for Education, officially declared the school open on 18 July 2003.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in environmental science, focusing on developing confident learners and caring citizens. In the same year, the school also implemented its Learning for Life Programme in sports and outdoor education, focusing on nurturing responsible citizens and lifelong learners.

#### **School Motto**
Success through Diligence

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/queenswaysec1.jpg">

The school emblem consists of three sub-designs against a purple background, which represents royalty. The upper part of the emblem depicts a torch encircled by a laurel. The torch represents learning and knowledge while the laurel is the resultant success. The left design originates from the basic emblem of the City of Singapore – a lion on a castle. The lion represents courage and excellence while the castle on which it stands represents strength and stability. The spiderweb on the right represents due diligence, which is a prerequisite for success.

The main quality that all Queenswayans should strive to attain is diligence, which will ensure success, hence the school motto, ‘Success through Diligence’.

We are proud to proclaim<br>
We are Queenswayans in name<br>
Members of Queensway Secondary School<br>
Onward we march towards success<br>
In studies, in sports and in service

(Chorus)<br>
Queensway, Queensway<br>
Long may she remain<br>
In splendid honour<br>
Bright as day

We will hold our heads high<br>
As we see our flag fly<br>
Infront of Queensway Secondary School<br>
Loyally, joyfully, we strive<br>
As leaders of courage and foresight

(Repeat Chorus)
