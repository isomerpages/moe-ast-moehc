#### **School Motto**
Each His Best

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/princesselizabethpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Our school crest is the symbol of the school’s aspiration. The torch represents knowledge. The white and green background represents progression from ignorance to knowledge. The white background represents purity of thought, word and deed. The semicircle represents the school’s aim to provide its students with an all-round education. The three interlocking rings symbolise diligence, endurance and team spirit. The motto ‘Each His Best’ signifies every member of the school giving his or her best to achieve excellence.

Princess Elizabeth Primary School<br>
Now we hear you call<br>
As members we will serve you<br>
that teaches us all

Never from the good we stray<br>
We will always strive<br>
Each at his best attempting<br>
Higher aims in life.

Princess Elizabeth forever<br>
None more loved can be<br>
Harder ever harder<br>
We will strive for thee

Unity will be our best aim<br>
Praise we’ll always gain<br>
Both in learning and in games.<br>
Merits obtain.

Through calm or stormy times<br>
Each will do the best<br>
Helping each other always<br>
Smiling through the test.

Princess Elizabeth forever<br>
None more loved can be<br>
Harder ever harder<br>
We will strive for thee
