#### **School History**
Fuchun Primary School was established in 1985 at Woodlands Centre Road to serve children living in the Marsiling and Woodlands areas. It was officially opened on 14 August 1987. The school started as a double-session school with 1,200 pupils and 37 classrooms. It moved to its current site at Woodlands Avenue 1 on 18 November 2005, taking over a school building that had been upgraded under PRIME. The school transited to single session in 2016. Fuchun Primary has established itself in Woodlands as a school with a caring culture and known for its music education. Through the school’s Learning for Life Programme in Music Education and Performing Arts, students are given opportunities to perform or exhibit their artworks publicly to groom them to become confident performers.

#### **School Motto**
Ever Onward

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/fuchunpri9.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school emblem is created through the fusion of F, C, P & S which stands for Fuchun Primary School.

The design projects togetherness and unity, and the Bird-in-Flight motif symbolises the soaring spirit of both students and staff. This is in keeping with the school motto "EVER ONWARD".

The colours, gold and blue, symbolise purity and success through perseverance.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We are children of Fuchun School<br>
Ever proud to be in this school<br>
Day by day we learn and play<br>
Striving forward on our way

Chorus:<br>
Now we sing this song each day<br>
To tell the world what part we'll play<br>
Fuchun School is here to stay<br>
We will march forth, come what may

Like a beacon tall and bright<br>
Harbouring a guiding light<br>
Leading us to heights above<br>
Loyal to the school we love
