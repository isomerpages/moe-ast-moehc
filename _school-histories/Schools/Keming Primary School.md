#### **School History**
Keming Primary School has a legacy that is rich in values.    
  
Established in 1935 as the Chinese-medium Keok Ming Public School, Keming was funded by philanthropic pioneers who believed in bringing education to the villagers. In Chinese, keok (克) means “to overcome difficulties” and ming (明) means “brightness”. Thus the name Keok Ming refers to one’s ability to overcome adversity for a promising future.  
  
True to its name, the school demonstrated its fighting spirit by overcoming many challenges, especially in its early years. With its first batch of 20 students, the school shared a wayang (opera) stage in Holland Village with the wayang performers because it did not have its own building. Eventually, the school found a home at Chip Bee Gardens. Later, with the arrival of the Second World War in Singapore, lessons were suspended, resuming only in August 1945.  
  
To recognise the contribution of the school towards educating the children, the government accorded it the status of a government-aided school in 1957, thus supporting the school with funds and grants.    
   
In 1962, the school faced another crisis: It had to relocate as the owner wanted the land back. Fortunately, with the assistance of then Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, the school relocated to Buona Vista by the Ministry of Education. Mr Lee officially opened the school at its new premises in 1966.  
  
In 1974, to meet the increasing needs of a growing school, hawkers in the Holland Road area raised funds for the school. The camaraderie of the community came across strongly during the fundraising campaign, as the public, private organisations and staff came forward in unity to make donations.  
  
After attaining full government status in 1982, the school was renamed Keok Ming Primary, and in 1983, became an English-medium school. In 1987, the school moved to Bukit Batok and has since been known as Keming Primary School.

#### **School Motto**
Grow and Glow

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/kemingpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school emblem depicts the school as a child-centred institution which believes that every student should be developed to his full potential.   
  
Each ring with a broad base and tapering at its upper extreme recognizes the individual differences of our students.  These rings also represent the intellectual, physical, social, moral, emotional and aesthetic growth of a child.  
  
The apparent movement of the blue stripes which also stand for an open book underlines the academic progress and the need for an all-round development of our students through the co-curricular activities in the school.  Visibly manifested by the white background is the emphasis on the moral upbringing of our students.  
  
“Grow and glow” as our motto underscores the fundamental philosophy of our school and is crystallised by the bold boundary.  
  
Viewed as a whole, the emblem portrays the school as an embodiment of growth for all in the search for progress, unity, beauty and the truth.

O Keming we have come<br>
To learn, to share and to care<br>
We will serve with pride and honour<br>
For the glory yours and mine.

We will grow and we will glow,<br>
Together we will build<br>
We will grow and we will glow,<br>
A better tomorrow<br>

Let the motto be our guide,<br>
Together we work and learn.<br>
Forward, upward we will strive,<br>
There’s a place for everyone.

We will grow and we will glow,<br>
Together we will build<br>
We will grow and we will glow,<br>
A better tomorrow<br>
