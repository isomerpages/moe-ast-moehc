#### **School History**
Endeavour Primary School (EDP) was founded in 2008 with the mission of providing a holistic education that prepares its students well for the future. The school creates a child-centred environment to meet the learning needs of its students, and to bring about cognitive, aesthetic, moral, physical and social development in their formative years of education.

Over the past decade, the school has successfully implemented diverse programmes to provide enriching learning experiences for the pupils and to cater to their holistic development. The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Every Child A Performer’, benefits all students at various levels of development. Besides cultivating interest and nurturing talent in the performing arts, the programme emphasises character-building and citizenship education to prepare students for the 21st century. Through the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), ‘Nurturing Thinkers through Knowledge-Building Practices’, teachers model the inquiry process while encouraging students to build on each other’s knowledge via the online Knowledge Forum, and to be engaged in collaborative learning. The ALP is designed to support the progressive development of thinking, communication and collaboration skills among students.

The year 2018 marked the 10th anniversary of EDP. The school celebrated this milestone with meaningful events such as the EDP Homecoming Carnival and School Musical, and activities like the EDP Orchid Hybridisation Programme and EDP Murals, which were jointly put together by staff and students. The Homecoming Carnival was a fun-filled and memorable event where staff, parents and students of the past and present reconnected and reminisced about their memories of the school.

Endeavour All the Way<br>
As the days and years go by,<br>
We will fly our blue flag high,<br>
We will work hard to achieve greater heights,<br>
For the best, we will strive.<br>
With courage we will triumph,<br>
With strength we will succeed,<br>
We will spread our name throughout the world,<br>
With our great blue flag unfurled.

Chorus<br>
Endeavour all the way,<br>
We will get there someday,<br>
With diligence and perseverance,<br>
Will lead us all the way.<br>
Endeavour all the way,<br>
In one voice you'll hear us say,<br>
Together we forever will<br>
Endeavour all the way.<br>
Together we forever will<br>
Endeavour all the way.
