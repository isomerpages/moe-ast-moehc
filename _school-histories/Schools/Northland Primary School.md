#### **School History**
Northland Primary School was established in 1988 as a government co-educational school at Yishun Avenue 4. The school was officially opened on 17 April 1990. In 2015, the school completed its PERI upgrading, and in 2018, Northland Primary School celebrated its 30th anniversary.

In 2014, Northland Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘My Story, My Stage’. The programme aims to give students a voice, as well as a quality space and platforms to grow their self-confidence through music and drama. One such platforms is the school’s biennial public performance, _APPLAUSE_.

Northland Primary School is also known for its international chess programme. In the early years, the school had iC@N, an innovative programme for school-based excellence which uses the learning of international chess to nurture the students’ strategic and critical thinking skills as well as to develop sound game etiquette. In 2016, the programme became the Applied Learning Programme in Thinking Skills, which aims to teach students how to think critically, analytically, reflectively and creatively through a systematic and explicit approach.

#### **School Motto**
Steadfast and Honest

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/northlandpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The colours of the school crest are blue and yellow. The rising sun at the top of the crest represents the rising spirit of Northland Primary School. Just like the sun’s glow, the glow of the school flashes outward in all directions and touches all it comes in contact with. The book, in the shape of a tree with spreading branches, is symbolic of the school’s pursuit of learning and academic excellence. The healthy, fully formed leaves beneath the shade of the spreading branches are symbolic of the love and nurturing that the students receive under its aegis. Cradling the crest is the school motto – Steadfast and Honest.
