#### **School History**
East Spring Secondary School is a government co-educational school established in 1999. The school first operated at the site of Junyuan Secondary School and moved to its current location at 30 Tampines Street 34 in mid-November 1999. Led by founding principal Mr Yong Kwei Leong, the school sought to develop well-rounded students, with an emphasis on character, leadership as well as the performing and visual arts. 

In 2017, led by the fourth principal, Mr Teoh Teik Hoe, the school received the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course, affirming the school’s holistic efforts and programmes to enable all students to discover their strengths and experience success. In 2019, East Spring Secondary School merged with East View Secondary School, retaining its name and operating at its premises.

East Spring Secondary’s Applied Learning Programme, ‘21st Century Innovators through Health Science’, prepares students for the future through the learning and application of skills, concepts and knowledge related to health science. This unique programme allows students to acquire and apply critical thinking skills and develop the dispositions of an inquiring mind. The school also seeks to develop student leadership skills through its Learning for Life Programme in community and youth leadership. The programme, comprising both formal training and experiential learning opportunities, is designed for students to develop the self-awareness to lead themselves, as well as to influence others in making a difference to the community. The school celebrated its 20th anniversary on 5 July 2019.

#### **School Motto**
Towards Excellence and Success

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/eastspringsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The East Spring Secondary School’s crest is a symbol of trust and partnership, uniting the two merged schools. The rays emerging from the letter ‘e’ depict a young rising sun from the east. This symbolises the renewed and vibrant spirit that the staff and students possess to strive towards excellence and success. The stylised letters ‘e’ and ‘s’ in the centre of the crest convey the perfect marrying of the two schools. The subtle ‘v’ linked by the two letters forms a heart, signifying the compassion and synergy of the staff and students. It also reinforces the school’s belief in a values-driven education to inspire students to be concerned, gracious and grateful citizens who give back to the community.

East Springians, stand up together<br>
As we face each day with zest<br>
Seize the moment, working hard<br>
Towards excellence and success

Striding with determination<br>
Paving the way for the rest<br>
Reaching out with confidence<br>
Inspired to withstand the test

Now and forever, we honour our school<br>
Giving all our hearts, giving all our best

Singing in one voice, united and strong<br>
All in euphony, all in harmony

East Spring Secondary<br>
Champions, we are!
