#### **School History**
New Town Secondary School has been preparing the young for success for more than 50 years. Established in 1965, the school started operations in Queenstown, providing education to students in both the Chinese and English streams. By 1975, it was the largest school in Singapore with 3,540 students. In 1987, the Chinese-medium classes ceased but the school opened its doors to pre-university students. The pre-university classes were subsequently closed in 1991 for the school to focus on providing secondary education. In 1992, the school became single-session. In 1998, New Town Secondary School relocated to its current premises on Dover Road to meet the growing demand of the schooling needs of residents in Clementi and West Coast.

Over the years, the school has offered a myriad of programmes to develop students holistically in the cognitive, aesthetics, moral, physical and social domains, especially in National Education, which was further enhanced through its niche in uniformed groups.

In 2015, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary. It combined efforts with the New Town Alumni to organise various homecoming events. In the same year, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Developing Confident and Compassionate Student Leaders to Lead, Serve and Excel’. The programme reconceptualises the school as a community of young aspiring leaders who inspire people around them.

In 2016, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Developing Critical and Inventive Thinkers through Visual Communication’. In 2017, the school began offering the Enhanced Arts Programme, which lays the foundation for building confidence in students to discover and push their artistic boundaries.

#### **School Motto**
To Forge a Better Life

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/newtownsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The badge features the name of the school in both English and Chinese. It is in three colours – white, black and red. White represents purity, sincerity and honesty. Black represents perseverance and steadfastness. Red represents aspirations, warmth and unity.

At the centre of the badge is a flower made up of many petals encircling a cogwheel. The flower stands for scholastic achievement, while the cogwheel signifies the nation’s progress and development. Education is the inculcation of all the above attributes. It is hoped that, with these qualities, a Newtowner will be able to forge a better future for him/herself and the community, contributing to the nation’s progress and development.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

By Dover in Clementi is a school that we grow<br>
Her motto ‘To Forge Better Lives’<br>
She’s laid in green lawns<br>
Against blue skies above<br>
That’s where we share laughter and tears

To be under once more<br>
The flag of our school<br>
The pride that we share<br>
New Town Secondary School

Chorus:<br>
Here is to New Town a school where we belong<br>
We’ll learn, grow together and keep our friendships strong<br>
We will give of our best, shine in all that we do<br>
So here is to New Town, To New Town...hurray!

Our years may go by<br>
But our fond mem’ries stay<br>
The road up ahead paves the way<br>
But throughout the days<br>
That our long years may bring<br>
Just one thought will gladden the heart

To be under once more<br>
The flag of our school<br>
The pride that we share<br>
New Town Secondary School

Chorus:<br>
Here is to New Town a school where we belong<br>
We’ll learn, grow together and keep our friendships strong<br>
We will give of our best, shine in all that we do<br>
So here is to New Town, To New Town...hurray!
