#### **School History**
Tun Seri Lanang Secondary School was established in 1963 as Singapore's second Malay - medium&nbsp; secondary school at Mountbatten Road. The school had been named after Tun Seri Lanang who was the author of the&nbsp;_Sejarah Melayu_&nbsp;(Malay Annals) and was&nbsp;_Bendahara_&nbsp;(Prime Minister) to the Sultan of Johor when the Johor sultanate was attacked by the Portuguese and the Acehnese.  
  
The school was an early proponent of providing a regional experience for its students. It hence organised various overseas excursions and hosted full-time students from Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia. It was also the alma mater to several local sporting figures.

In 1980, the school introduced an English Language stream alongside its existing Malay Language stream. As of the same year, 94% of students were in the English Language stream and 460 students learned Chinese as a second language.  
  
When the school closed in 1987, it had an enrolment number of 139 students and was located at Mountbatten Road.

To pay tribute to the historical figures that gave the schools their name, Tun Seri Lanang is honoured through the establishment of Tun Seri Lanang Award, one of the highest awards for Malay literature in Singapore.&nbsp;

#### **School Song**
**Malay**&nbsp;(1963-1980)

Tun Seri Lanang name di-beri<br>
Pada bangunan sekolah kita ini<br>
Nama sa-orang yang amat bijak bistari<br>
Amat-lah termashhor di-puji santeri.

Sekolah kita ini sangat-lah indah<br>
Tiada tolok bandingan-nya<br>
Usaha kita jangan-lah sudah<br>
Untok sama mejayakan-ya.

Pelajaran kita susun dengan teliti<br>
Usahakan-lah jangan berhenti<br>
Mana yang salah kita amat-amati<br>
Semoga kelak dapat kita berbakti

Menuntut ilmu jangan-lah kepalang<br>
Ilmu kita jadikan pelita hati<br>
Agar chita kita tidak terhalang<br>
Sampai di-dalam hati.

**Chrous**<br>
Tun Seri Lanang… Tun Seri Lanang<br>
Tun Seri Lanang sekolah kita<br>
Maju-lah… Maju-lah<br>
Tun Seri Lanang<br>
Menjadi Lambang Sekolah kita.


**English**&nbsp;(1980-1987)

In time long past, on yonder land,<br>
A pioneer, inspired, made his stand.<br>
His dignity, his industry, a symbol make;<br>
For a beacon his name we do take.

**Chorus**<br>
With pride, with joy, with hope we bring<br>
This grateful song as one we sing<br>
“Tun Seri Lanang, I call thee mine,<br>
Tun Seri Lanang, long may you shine.”

We seek wisdom that we might<br>
Have courage to strongly feel it right<br>
That ‘Knowledge is self-esteem’ as our creed<br>
Is one in faith we may heed.
