#### **School History**
Established in 2000, Compassvale Secondary School (CVSS) began operations from Sengkang Secondary School for six months before moving to its current premises at 51 Compassvale Crescent. In 2002, the school conceptualised the North Star Education Programme to provide a holistic education and quality school experience for students. Since 2005, students of Compassvale Secondary School have been called ‘North Stars’. The school aims to develop every student into a ‘North Star’, shining brightly with impeccable character and excellence in both academic and non-academic pursuits.

The school’s curriculum is based on a framework for integrated, engaged and assessed learning with teachers as learning designers, collaborative learners and holistic educators.&nbsp;In 2015, CVSS celebrated its 15th anniversary with a commemorative book chronicling its humble beginnings and journey of excellence. During the event, the North Star Room showcasing the school’s past and present was launched.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 2016, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in aeronautics and the Learning for Life Programme in community and youth leadership, as part of a new strategic direction to establish its strengths in science, technology, engineering and mathematics as well as community service.

The star&nbsp;on the school crest is symbolic of the school’s identity: the North Star. It speaks of an unwavering focus and determination in achieving the school’s vision. Embodied in the star are the values of graciousness, gratitude, respect, responsibility, resilience, integrity and teamwork. These core values undergird and support the ‘North Star’ in becoming an innovative contributor and upright citizen with a global outlook.
