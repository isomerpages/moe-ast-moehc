#### **School History**
Founded in 1892, Holy Innocents’ High School was one of the first Chinese mission schools in Singapore. It was originally named Tao Nan School. Bible studies and classical Chinese were taught to children in the Upper Serangoon village. In 1920, Reverend Father Becheras, the school supervisor, renamed the school Holy Innocents’ Chinese Boys’ School to reflect the aspiration for the boys to be pure, wholesome and innocent. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore from 1942 to 1945, the school was known as Syonan School.

In 1957, a two-storey building with 12 classrooms was built for the school at 7¼-milestone Upper Serangoon Road. Reverend Father Anthony Shih was appointed as the principal, supported by his deputy, Reverend Father Peter Lu. Secondary-level classes officially started in 1958, and the name of the school was modified to Holy Innocents’ High School. His Grace, Archbishop, Right Reverend M. Olcomendy, blessed the school and declared it open on 6 June 1958. Pre-university classes in the science stream were begun in 1965.

As the school’s enrolment grew, the primary school section moved to Lorong Low Koon on 25 March 1985 and functioned as Holy Innocents’ Primary School. The secondary school section became single-session. Between 1992 and 1994, Holy Innocents’ High School underwent construction and refurbishing. The official commissioning of the upgraded facilities by Gregory Yong, Archbishop of Singapore, took place on 30 July 1994.

#### **School Motto**
谦诚和爱

Sincerity and Charity

The school motto in Chinese stresses on four areas of student development: intellect, morality, physical wellness and harmony. The four areas branch out and include values such as humility, diligence, integrity, kindness, respect, righteousness, sincerity and charity.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/hihs1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest – embodying the colours red, blue and white – is shaped like a shield with the cross at the centre. The shield represents the defence of our faith with Christ at the centre of our lives. The colour red symbolises the blood of Christ. Blue symbolises the ever-soothing presence of our Mother Mary who is always there for us, while white represents sincerity and honesty. The Chinese character, 诚 (integrity), features at the top of the crest, symbolising the need to continually uphold the virtue to be honest with God, others and self.
