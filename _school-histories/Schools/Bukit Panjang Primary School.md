#### **School History**
Established in 1932, Bukit Panjang English School, as it was then known, was one of the very few primary schools in the northern part of Singapore. The school’s staff had to go to Bukit Panjang Village and the nearby district to persuade parents to send their children to school. After much effort and with the assistance of a prominent resident, they managed to enrol the first 60 pupils. Two teachers taught all the pupils in the school, but word soon spread about Bukit Panjang English School.   
  
From a humble beginning of two classes, the school grew from strength to strength. In 1941, there were classes from Standard One to Standard Six. The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation and only reopened in January 1948.  
  
In 1948, the principal, Mr C.A. Peterson, took office. He left in 1951 and was succeeded by Mr Wee Loh Siew. By then, the student enrolment had increased to 350.   
  
To cope with the increasing demand for places, the Bukit Panjang Government Afternoon School was opened in July 1952, with an initial enrolment of 112. During this period, the school published an annual magazine, which now provides an invaluable record of the school in the 1950s. The school’s legacy lives on today with its annual newsletter and commemorative anniversary magazines.
