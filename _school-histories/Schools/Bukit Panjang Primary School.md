#### **School History**
Bukit Panjang Government School, established in 1932, was one of the few primary schools in northern Singapore. The first enrollment of sixty students was made possible through the staff's persuasion and the help of Assemblyman Mr. Goh Tong Liang. The school continued to grow under the leadership of principals Mr. C.A. Peterson and Mr. Wee Loh Siew, with an increasing student enrollment that led to the opening of the Bukit Panjang Government Afternoon School in 1952.

During the 1960s, the school excelled in athletics, and in the 1970s, academic excellence became a priority under the guidance of principal Mr. Chen Yoon Chee. Mr. Chew Soi Tee took over in 1985 and continued the tradition of high academic standards.

In 1990, the school relocated to a new building on Cashew Road to better serve the residents of Bukit Panjang. Two years later, with 62 classes and 2,256 students, the school celebrated its 60th anniversary with Mr. Lee Yiok Seng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for National Development and Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC, as Guest of Honour.

With the "Thinking Schools, Learning Nation" vision, the school emphasized national education, creative thinking, collaborative learning, and ICT literacy, receiving significant upgrades in 2002 under PRIME. In 2013, the school received the niche status for i2Can Dance, and in 2014, completed the PERI XP Upgrade with an Indoor Sports Hall and a 4-story extension block that housed new music, LSP, and LSM rooms.It was also made wheel-chair friendly.

The school became single-session in 2015, offering Critical &amp; Appreciative Reading to Respond Empathetically (CAR²E) for Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 2021. Today, the school's legacy continues with its annual newsletter and commemorative anniversary magazines.

In 2022, the school celebrated its 90th anniversary amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Bukit Panjang Primary School's long history of growth and academic excellence is a testament to the dedication of its staff and students over the years.
