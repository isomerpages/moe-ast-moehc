#### **School History**
Haig Boys’ School was established on 10 September 1951 at 25 Jalan Tembusu. The school was named after Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, British Commander-in-Chief during the Battle of the Somme. It functioned as a double-session school.

In 1988, the school was relocated to 231 Mountbatten Road and became a single-session school. From 1991, primary five and primary six students would participate in the annual overseas learning trip where they travelled to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Japan.

On 2 January 2001, Haig Boys’ School merged with Fowlie Primary School and Mountbatten Primary School to become Tanjong Katong Primary School.

#### **School Song**
Boys of Haig Boys’ let’s all strive<br>
Towards a better life<br>
Which is the goal towards which we drive<br>
Where happiness is rife.

**Chorus:**<br>
Come on lads<br>
Let’s try our best in everything we do<br>
It’s only to our interest<br>
And for our country too.

Let’s not fear to soil our hands<br>
For toil brings us progress<br>
And sweat and labour are our friends<br>
Without them we regress.
