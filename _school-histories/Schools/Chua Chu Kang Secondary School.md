#### **School History**
Chua Chu Kang Secondary School was established in 1992 as the first secondary school in Choa Chu Kang Town. The school has since operated from its premises at Teck Whye Crescent.

Following the initial founding years, the school has focused on its mission to provide a holistic education for students and is guided by the conviction that all students can excel. Espousing the belief that every child can be a leader in his/her own right, the school focuses on developing leadership qualities as part of its character development programme. In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in student leadership development.

In 2016, the school started its Applied Learning Programme in robotics and automation against a backdrop of changing national needs and future trends. The programme aims to develop students’ 21st-century skills and to future-proof them as they navigate an increasingly complex world.

In 2018, the school celebrated its silver jubilee.
