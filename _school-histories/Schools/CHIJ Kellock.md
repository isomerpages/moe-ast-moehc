#### **School History**
The official founding date of CHIJ Kellock is 1964, but the origin of the school dates back to the 1930s. At the time, it was known as Our Lady of Lourdes School and subsequently Primary School II, before adopting its present name.  
  
The school began in makeshift classrooms as a parish school of Our Lady of Lourdes Church on Ophir Road. In 1959, the classrooms were demolished and the school relocated to the Convent at Victoria Street, where it functioned in the afternoon as School II.  
  
With the increase in enrolment, a new primary school became necessary. The late Archbishop Michael Olcomendy donated the land next to St Bernadette’s Church to Infant Jesus (IJ) Rev. Mother St. John. There, CHIJ Kellock was finally set up in 1964 and the pupils of Primary School II of Victoria Street were moved there.  
  
In the 1990s, space constraint posed a major problem at the Kellock Road site. It could not be upgraded to include new facilities to provide for information and communications technology lessons. In 1994, CHIJ (Kellock) moved out of Kellock Road and was temporarily located at 11 Jalan Kuala during the construction of a new school building at Bukit Teresa in Kampong Bahru. CHIJ (Kellock) moved into its new school building in 2002, and was officially opened in 2004.  
  
The year 2014 was a milestone in CHIJ Kellock’s history, when it celebrated its 50th anniversary. Themed “My Journey, Our Journey – Honouring Our Past, Celebrating Our Present, Co-creating the Future”, the celebration was for all who have been shaped by the school and carry within them cherished memories of their formative childhood experiences in the school, be it during the early years at Kellock Road and Jalan Kuala or at Bukit Teresa Road.

#### **School Motto**
_Simple Dans Ma Vertu, Forte Dans Devoir (French Version)<br>
__Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty (English Version)_

To be **Simple in Virtue** is to cultivate a personal honesty which helps us relate to others with respect, openness and sincerity. Virtue is nobleness of character nurtured by a genuine desire to live according to God’s will as revealed in the Gospel.

To be **Steadfast in Duty** is to be faithful in fulfilling our obligations and having the capacity to rise above difficulties or obstacles to execute and complete a task in the service of others.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/chijkellock1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The CHIJ badge or crest (called the Blason, in French) was designed by Mere Saint Aloysia, Superior General (1877 – 1901) and her senior students of 1894.

At the centre of the school crest lies a red shield with a silver band edged in gold. On the right side of the shield is the Book of Gospels with a silver rosary. On the left is a golden distaff and spindle. The shield, surmounted by a gold cross, is encircled by a garland of marguerites. Emblazoned on the crest is the motto of all CHIJ schools:-

<figure><figcaption><strong>  
Simple in Virtue, Steadfast in Duty

The **cross** is the symbol of our salvation and the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.

The open **Gospel** represents the teachings of Christ and is a source of inspiration that guides the school community. The **silver** **rosary** symbolizes prayer and is the story of the Gospel as seen through the eyes of Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

The **golden distaff** and **spindle** are symbols of womanly labour and remind us of the dignity of work and the satisfaction and fulfilment to be found in a task well-accomplished.

The **red shield** symbolizes God’s all-embracing message of love.

The garland of **marguerites** is symbolic of purity and simplicity – charming traits of girlhood.
