#### **School History**
Clementi Primary School was established in 2001 with the merger of Clementi North Primary School and Clementi Town Primary School. It moved to its new building at Clementi Avenue 3 in December 2002. The new building was officially opened in 2003. In the same year, the Talent Corner was created to provide a space to identify and develop students’ talents.

Between 2011 and 2013, the school developed the school-based excellence programme for visual arts, which later became its distinctive Learning for Life Programme in 2014. The school environment became a canvas for art. The Artique, Art Corridors and Ceramics Work Room were created to produce and showcase Clementians’ artworks.

In collaboration with the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy in the Pathfinder Programme since 2012, the school has been a base for sharing good pedagogical practices with schools within the cluster and zone.

In 2016, the school transited to single session and co-curricular activities were incorporated within curriculum time for all Primary Three to Primary Six students

That year, the school also embarked on an after-school programme to cater to the different abilities of Clementians. The design of the programme was intended to further stimulate students’ interest in learning and allow them to relate and apply the concepts they have learnt during curriculum time to real-life situations. 

The school completed its PERI upgrading in 2018.

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Jean Sng (2001–2007)<br>
\- Mrs Chandler Jay Siva (2008–2014)<br>
\- Mr Chia See Chew Albert (2015–present)

#### **School Motto**
Others Before Self

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/clementipri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crescent speaks of the pupils as a new generation important to the survival of the nation in the future.
The school motto is portrayed by the two persons, the one in the front being of more significance than the other, emphasising students' willingness to be considerate and the preparedness to make personal sacrifices by putting others before self in their actions.

The steps represent the school as an institution that provides the opportunities for continuous improvement and growth in all aspects of development of its pupils.

The inner smaller circle stands for the holistic education to be provided.

This inner circle, together with the crescent moon, symbolises a smiling face, helping to portray a happy learning environment that the adults are committed to provide for the children.

The **outer bigger circle** is the symbol of strength, stability and safety.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

The star of our future is shining bright<br>
Let us move hand in hand towards that light.<br>
We will nurture our talents, develop our minds<br>
As we journey onwards and keep pace with time.

Arise, Clementians, stand up and walk tall.<br>
Be bold in our purpose, be kind to all<br>
Striving to excel, giving of our best.<br>
Never fear or falter when we’re put to the test.

In our work and play we’ll help one another.<br>
For under the heavens we’re sisters and brothers<br>
So strengthen our bond, be united as one<br>
And make our CTP second to none.
