#### **School History**
Founded in April 1981, Jurong Junior College (JJ) was the ninth junior college in Singapore. In the beginning, the campus had to be hurriedly put together; despite various conversions to the building to house a junior college, “the facilities were grossly inadequate”, according to Mr Koh Beng Thiam, JJ’s first principal. While the campus was situated in an idyllic setting facing the large expanse of Pandan Reservoir, there were almost no facilities for sports.  

Before even finding a new home, JJ had begun carving a reputation for itself, participating in and winning various competitions. More significantly, the pioneer batch of students laid the foundations of the local _xinyao_ movement when they held a concert featuring original songs that they had composed. In the midst of the college’s teething problems, these achievements were heartening and inspiring, planting the roots for future achievements.

In 1985, staff and students moved to their permanent home at 800 Corporation Road. The patience of staff and students were rewarded as all classrooms were air-conditioned – a rarity even today – due to the deafening sounds of the Republic of Singapore Air Force airplanes from the nearby Tengah Airbase.

In 2006, the college was selected as the fourth Centre for the Language Elective Programme (Chinese) and the Centre of Excellence for Character Development in the West Zone. JJ was also the first junior college in Singapore to receive the Outstanding Development Award for Character Development that year. The college was revalidated for this award in 2011. 

Over the years, there were ongoing efforts to create a unique JJ identity that would be enduring as well as a sense of belonging. Eventually, the core values were distilled into: appreciation, responsibility, motivation and discipline.

These were reinforced by the college’s vision and mission, which were refined by the various principals who helmed JJ. The school’s vision was ‘College of Choice, Education of Value’, and its mission was ‘Nurturing confident learners with a global outlook. Developing leaders of character with a heart to serve’.

In 2017, with the announcement of an impending school merger with Pioneer Junior College, the college held a homecoming event that coincided with the Pioneer Batch Reunion. To mark the cessation of operations at 800 Corporation Road, 2018 culminated with _Curtain Call: The Final Homecoming_ at Jurong Campus, which saw some 5,000 members of the extended JJ family returning to bid a fond farewell to the college.

#### **School Motto**
Plus Ultra<br>
Latin for ‘This Far and Farther’

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/jurongjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is a silver teardrop shape on a green background. During a rebranding exercise in the early 2000s, green became the principle colour. The crest features concentric arcs depicting the two ‘J’s and the dot above the letters. Together, they form the shape of a teardrop signifying the efforts of all in the college to attain their desired outcomes. The colour green conveys the spirit of youthful enthusiasm, energy and dynamism – essential ingredients for achievement and progress.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

The road unwinds before us<br>
And we must venture on<br>
Towards the bright tomorrow<br>
Which faith and hope enthrone<br>
We shall not stay nor linger<br>
We shall not shrink nor fail<br>
But hand in hand together<br>
Strike out along the trail

Head, heart and hand we offer<br>
That none will fail the test<br>
“Plus Ultra” leads us farther<br>
Until we are the best
  
And on our backs the armour<br>
Forged in our College days<br>
And in our eyes the light of truth<br>
This College sets ablaze

Head, heart and hand we offer<br>
That none will fail the test<br>
“Plus Ultra” leads us farther<br>
Until we are the best
