#### **School History**
Punggol Secondary School was established in 1957 as the Chinese-medium Singapore Girls’ Vocational High School, located on Oxley Road. In 1977, the school was relocated to Toa Payoh East and renamed Pei Dao Secondary School in the following year. It offered English-stream classes and became co-educational. In 1986, Pei Dao relinquished its aided-school status and became a government school.

In 2001, Pei Dao moved to Punggol and was renamed Punggol Secondary School. The school retained its Chinese name because of its strong emphasis on the character development of students.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme is in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, focusing on environment education. Its Learning For Life Programme is in community and youth leadership, which aims to develop confident learners and leaders guided by values, motivated to excel.&nbsp;
