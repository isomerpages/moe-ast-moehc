#### **School History**
Established in the late 1950s, Pulau Tekong Primary School was located in Pulau Tekong. Pulau Tekong Primary School initially functioned as two separate schools - Pulau Tekong English School and Pulau Tekong Chinese School. In 1961, there were 428 students in Pulau Tekong Chinese School and 201 students in Pulau Tekong English School.  
  
In 1962, both schools combined administrations to form Pulau Tekong Integrated School. The amalgamated school functioned under one Principal.  
  
In 1985, Pulau Tekong Primary School merged with Kiau Nam School and was relocated to Tampines. The newly amalgamated school was named Qiaonan Primary School. In 2015, Qiaonan Primary School merged with Griffiths Primary School to form Angsana Primary School.&nbsp; Since 1985, the former site of the school has been a part of the Singapore military base in Pulau Tekong.&nbsp;&nbsp;
