#### **School History**
White Sands Primary School is a new merger between Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School in January 2019. The new merged school, which is led by Ms Audrey Wong, continues to operate at 2, Pasir Ris Street 11. A new school crest embodies a new beginning while the retention of key colours from the crests of both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School links the new school to a common heritage.

While both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary have served the community for more than 20 years, the merger presents an exciting future for students and staff in both schools. As our new school motto urges, we will “Learn, Grow and Excel Together”.&nbsp;

With the merger, elements from both schools are integrated to strengthen the holistic experience for the students. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Media and Technology from the former White Sands Primary and the Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) in Aesthetics from Coral Primary School are key programmes in the new merged school. Hence, moving forward, the students will be able to enjoy an enhanced learning experience from the strengths of the respective schools in curriculum and co-curriculum areas. &nbsp;

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Rammie Kuan (1998-2000)<br>
\- Mrs Dhillon Awtar Singh (2000-2007)<br>
\- Mrs Daphne Yeoh (2007-2012)<br>
\- Mr Ng Teng Joo (2012-2018)<br>

#### **School Motto**
Learn Grow and Excel Together

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/whitesandspri1.png">

Central to the crest is the design of people arising together. It signifies how the school partners the students, staff and community in soaring to greater heights. The broad white curves symbolise the waves, a feature that is symbolic of the coastal location of both Coral Primary School and White Sands Primary School. The thin red line symbolises the outline of a book where there is passionate learning of knowledge, skills and values. Together, they signify the school as the gateway in delivering quality education to our students and helping them to ride the waves of opportunities and challenges.

The inner ring encapsulating the design portrays a well-rounded and holistic education while the outer ring is symbolic of the continual learning and growth taking place in the school in the spirit of excellence.

There are four colours in the school crest, each with significant meaning. Blue conveys strength and steadfastness; White is the colour of purity and new beginnings while yellow represents hope and enlightenment. Red denotes passion and vibrancy in pursuit of excellence. Together they lend themselves to the notion of a bright future.

The school motto of “Learn Grow and Excel Together” represents the rallying together of students, staff and stakeholders to learn and grow to bring out the best in everyone’s potential.
