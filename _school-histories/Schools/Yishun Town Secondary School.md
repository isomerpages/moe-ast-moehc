#### **School History**
Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS) was established in January 1986 with nine classes and 13 pioneer teachers. It shared premises with Yishun Secondary School before moving into the campus at Yishun Street 21 on 31 March 1988. The school was officially opened on 29 July 1988.

In 1997, YTSS underwent structural enhancements and the Bougainvillea Block was extended to allow for more classrooms. This paved the way for a smooth transition to single session in the following year.

Between 1999 and 2005, the school saw various changes, including architectural enhancements, to create a more conducive and vibrant teaching-learning environment. The new facilities included the Pondok Yidao, barbeque pits, eco-pond, Orchid study area, Fern Lounge and the water fountain.

From 2006 to December 2007, YTSS underwent PRIME upgrading. In 2009, YTSS was awarded the School Distinction Award and the Best Practice Award for Teaching and Learning. In the following year, YTSS gained autonomous status.

In 2016, YTSS celebrated its 30th anniversary.
