#### **School History**
Jurong West Primary School (JWPS) was established on 4 January 1999 with seven Primary One classes. The school underwent upgrading in 2012 with an additional block, increasing the capacity to 46 classrooms and 19 special rooms. This enabled the school to transit to single-session in 2015. 

The school is cognisant of the growing demands and expectations of developing students who are future-ready and well anchored on sound moral values. Hence, its Applied Learning Programme, ‘The Art of Communication for Personal Excellence’, aims to equip students with explicit training in communication. The students undergo training in choral reading, reader’s theatre, storytelling and public speaking to develop them into confident communicators and creative individuals who are anchored in the school’s core values.

The school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP), ‘Experiential Learning of Lifeskills for Personal Excellence’ in 2014. The programme aims to build self-confidence in students through their interaction with nature, leadership skills, optimism in the recognition of their strengths and areas for improvement, and building resilience through resolving risks and challenges in a responsible manner. The range of activities organised by the school includes sports and games, outdoor education, basic rock climbing, adventure camp and water adventure camp. JWPS has adopted the stance of its LLP as experiential learning that heightens the students’ awareness of the outdoor via mastery lessons, deliberate action via application of skills and concepts taught, and the engendering of desired attitude via purposeful reflection and value reinforcement.

The school offers the programme, Active THInKER, where students get to enjoy structured free play of basketball, netball and captain’s ball every day during recess. This new initiative aims to allow for the application of skills learned during physical education lessons or co-curricular activities (CCAs) while promoting the importance of healthy living through sports and games. It also improves students’ concentration during lessons, provides a good opportunity for students to develop positive social skills with their peers, and is an excellent platform for CCA leaders to serve the school.

The school aims to nurture confident learners who use information and communications technology (ICT) for self-directed and collaborative learning safely and ethically. As part of the school’s holistic approach in promoting cyber wellness, a key programme, Cyber Wellness@JWPS, is integrated into the formal curriculum. To ensure that students acquire the necessary ICT skills in accordance to the baseline ICT standards, ICT-enriched lessons like interdisciplinary project work, digital storytelling as well as mathematics and science wireless trails are integrated into the curriculum and subject disciplines.
