#### **School History**
Founded by the Public Works Department in 1950, the school was located at St George’s Road. It provided education for children of the Public Works Department labourers living in the locality.

In 1960, St George’s Road Tamil School became a government Tamil school.

Upon the closure of the Umar Pulavar Tamil High School in 1982, St George’s Road Tamil School was renamed as the Umar Pulavar Tamil Language Centre in 1983.
