#### **School History**
In August 1888, Australian missionary Miss Sophia Blackmore started a school with eight Peranakan girls in the rented front room of a house on Cross Street. Despite parental indifference to education for girls at the time, Miss Blackmore persevered in her vision and more girls enrolled in the school. It later became known as the Telok Ayer Girls’ School.

To cope with the growing enrolment, Miss Mary Olson raised funds for a new school building at 178 Neil Road, which was completed in 1912. She renamed the school Fairfield Girls’ School in honour of the donor who had made the largest contribution of $5,000 in gold. At the time, the school only knew that the donor was a Mr Fairfield from New England.

The school ceased operations when World War II broke out in 1941, and the school was occupied by the Japanese. After the war, Fairfield Girls’ School reopened in October 1945 at borrowed premises of Pearl’s Hill School, as the school building on Neil Road had not been repaired.

In 1946, the first Asian principal, Mrs Lim Bock Kee, was appointed and the Neil Road site was ready to receive girls again. In 1958, the school was renamed Fairfield Methodist Girls’ School to mark its missionary beginnings. When Mrs Lim retired in 1959, Miss Lim Geok Kheng, a teacher and alumna, succeeded her. The school expanded rapidly and the physical facilities became inadequate for its needs. Miss Lim chaired the school’s Building Project Committee and played a key role in successfully relocating the school to larger premises on Dover Road in 1983.

The year 1983 also marked the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Fairfield. The school broke away from its 94-year-old tradition of being an all-girls school and became the first co-educational Methodist school in Singapore. It also split into primary and secondary schools, each with its own administration but both under the same board of management. Miss Cheong Yuen Lin and Mrs Tang Poh Kim, old girls of Fairfield, became the principals of Fairfield Methodist Primary School and Fairfield Methodist Secondary School respectively.

In 1995, Fairfield Methodist Secondary School became single-session, and was granted autonomous status in the following year. In 2009, the two schools were renamed Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) and Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary) to reflect their common origin and identity.

#### **School Motto**
Pure & Honest

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/fairfieldmethodistsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The emblem of the heart, which forms the central motif of the school crest, represents the highest of all emotions – love – the love of God for man and the love of man for his neighbour. Surmounting the heart is the torch of knowledge and wisdom that can illuminate the mind and broaden the vision of all who seek its light. Emblazoned in a band of burnished gold across the emblem of the heart is the name of the school, representing loyalty for the alma mater. The two stars at the base of the crest reflect the school motto, ‘Pure & Honest’, ideals that every student should aspire towards.

#### **School Song**

A world has opened for us<br>
A world that's bright and gay<br>
A world that's full of interest<br>
Since to school we found our way<br>
It's a world that's full of gladness<br>
And we're happy all the day<br>
And we learn that only busy folks<br>
Can be bright and true and gay<br>
It's at Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light

There we live and work and study<br>
There we walk in wisdom's ways<br>
Gaining strength for all the future<br>
Far and near we'll sing thy praise<br>
May blessings be upon thee<br>
May many find thy halls<br>
May the leaders of the future<br>
Be found within thy walls<br>
Here's to Fairfield, to Fairfield<br>
To every student here<br>
To every happy Fairsian<br>
And to every teacher dear<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And all the world is bright.
