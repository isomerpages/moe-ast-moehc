Fairfield was started by the faith of one lady - Miss Sophia Blackmore, a woman missionary from Australia, with a class of eight Nonya girls in a little room at Cross Street in 1888. Subsequently, the Telok Ayer Girls’ School was founded in August that year.

In 1912, when Miss Mary Olson was the Principal, the school expanded, moving to Neil Road and was named Fairfield Girls’ School, in honour of a generous donor, Mr Fairfield. After Miss Olson, Mrs Lim Bock Kee became the first Asian Principal to lead Fairfield Girls’ School in 1946. In 1958, the name of Fairfield Girls’ School was changed to Fairfield Methodist Girls’ School. When Mrs Lim retired in 1959, Miss Lim Geok Kheng, a teacher and old girl of the school, succeeded her as Principal until 1982.

1983 marked a new era in the history of Fairfield. It went co-educational with its re-location to Dover Road as two schools: Fairfield Methodist Primary and Fairfield Methodist Secondary Schools, headed by Miss Cheong Yuen Lin and Mrs Tang Poh Kim respectively. In 1995, Fairfield Methodist Secondary went single-session.

In 1996, Fairfield was amongst the first few groups of schools to gain autonomous status. Between 2001 and 2007, Fairfield continued to press forward in its mission to provide all its pupils with value-added education under the leadership of Miss Elaine Lim.

In December 2007, Mr Victor Owyong assumed school leadership, making history as the first male Principal to lead Fairfield Methodist Secondary School.

In 2009, to highlight the shared heritage of the two schools, their names were changed to Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) and Fairfield Methodist School (Secondary).

At the end of 2011, both schools wrote and adopted a common mission statement so as to achieve greater alignment with the educational mission of the Methodist Church in Singapore, and to achieve the concept of 'One Fairfield' with Fairfield Methodist School (Primary), which was further reinforced with a common badge. 

In December 2021, Mr Wee Tat Chuen became the first old boy of the school to take up the role of Principal. Mr Wee had previously been a teacher and Head of Department of Fairfield Methodist Secondary.

Today, we continue to stand as a school that is special, because of the staff and support we are blessed with, and because of the almighty and loving God whom we serve. His grace is evident in our school.

#### **School Motto**
Pure &amp; Honest

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/fairfieldmethodistsec1.jpg">

The emblem of the heart, which forms the central motif of the school crest, represents the highest of all emotions – love – the love of God for man and the love of man for his neighbour. Surmounting the heart is the torch of knowledge and wisdom that can illuminate the mind and broaden the vision of all who seek its light. Emblazoned in a band of burnished gold across the emblem of the heart is the name of the school, representing loyalty for the alma mater. The two stars at the base of the crest reflect the school motto, ‘Pure &amp; Honest’, ideals that every student should aspire towards.

A world has opened for us<br>
A world that's bright and gay<br>
A world that's full of interest<br>
Since to school we found our way<br>
It's a world that's full of gladness<br>
And we're happy all the day<br>
And we learn that only busy folks<br>
Can be bright and true and gay<br>
It's at Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And our hearts are gay and light

There we live and work and study<br>
There we walk in wisdom's ways<br>
Gaining strength for all the future<br>
Far and near we'll sing thy praise<br>
May blessings be upon thee<br>
May many find thy halls<br>
May the leaders of the future<br>
Be found within thy walls<br>
Here's to Fairfield, to Fairfield<br>
To every student here<br>
To every happy Fairsian<br>
And to every teacher dear<br>
Oh! It's Fairfield, at Fairfield<br>
Where all the world is bright<br>
Where love is in the sunshine<br>
And all the world is bright.
