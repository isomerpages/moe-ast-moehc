#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>

We bring the hopes of vibrant hearts<br>
To match the tasks ahead<br>
With unfailing knowledge and virtue<br>
We reach the goals we have laid<br>
In true devotion to our aims<br>
And plans that we have made.
 
**Chorus:**<br>
Delta, Delta our radiant way<br>
To reach the highest state<br>
Where education rules the mind<br>
And opens learning’s gate<br>
Imparting knowledge without end<br>
And strength that will not fade.
 
We shall forever bear the torch<br>
Triumphant we shall be<br>
No obstacle will prove too great<br>
From weakness we are free<br>
Building in Delta the ideal<br>
For family and country.
