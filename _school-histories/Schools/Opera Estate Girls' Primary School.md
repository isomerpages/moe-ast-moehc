#### **School History**
Opera Estate Girls’ Primary School was founded in the late 1950s. The school was located along Fidelio Street, next to Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School.

The school was in the spotlight in 1977, when four of their Primary Six students achieved good results in the then Science Teachers Association's Primary Science Quiz.  
  
The school also organised a funfair in 1979 to raise funds for the development of their school projects. In 1985, the school merged with Opera Estate Boys’ Primary School to form Opera Estate Primary School. The new school included green as one of its school colours to represent the school colour of Opera Estate Girls’ School.
