#### **School History**
St Gabriel’s Primary is a government-aided Catholic school run by the Brothers of St Gabriel. St Gabriel’s School opened its doors on 3 June 1953 to its first intake of 212 students. They attended classes ranging from Primary One to Standard Two under the supervision of Reverend Brother Louis Gonzaga and seven pioneer teachers. The school was then located at the junction of Hillside Drive and Upper Serangoon Road.

When the enrolment of the school rose to over 2,000 pupils in the 1960s, it became necessary to provide more space and facilities for the students. A project to build a separate primary school was launched. On 2 January 1969, the whole of the primary section of St Gabriel’s School, comprising 31 classes with an enrolment of 1,350 students, moved into the new building at the junction of Highland Road and Yio Chu Kang Road (next to the old Kok Wah Cinema, opposite the Five Milestone Wet Market). The primary school was blessed by Archbishop Michael Olcomendy and officially declared open on 12 July 1969.

On 2 January 1988, the 31 classes and 1,350 students of the school moved to its premises in Lorong Chuan. The official opening celebration of the school was held on 29 September 1989. The school was blessed by Archbishop Gregory Yong.

On 19 November 2003, the school moved to a holding site while the school building underwent PRIME upgrading. In November 2005, the school returned to new buildings and improved facilities at its Lorong Chuan premises.

On 26 March 2018, the school marked another milestone in its history with the completion of the PERI upgrading project. The on-site renewal project took place over a period of two years and saw the building of a new indoor sports hall with accompanying facilities such as a band performance room, dance studio, music room, and various outdoor experiential learning facilities to meet the students’ needs.

The core philosophy of St Gabriel’s Primary School, “Love Each Child as Your Own”, is augmented with the following educational philosophy:
*   Keeping the flame alive
*   The gift is theirs
*   Giving pupils a voice
*   The community connect

#### **School Motto**
Labor Omnia Vincit (Labour conquers all things)

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/stgabrielspri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The centrepiece of the school crest is the Coat of Arm, which has four quadrants. The top-left quadrant has the letters A.M. with the lily flower that is an abbreviation for "Ave Maria". This was the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary, the mother of Jesus. This is also the beginning of the "Hail Mary" prayer. According to St. Louis Marie de Montfort, Wisdom can be attained through living a life of gentleness and authenticity, modelled after Mary the mother of God.

The bottom-right quadrant has the letters D+S with a cross. D.S. is the abbreviation for Dieu Seul, which is God Alone in French. God Alone is the all-motivating force in the life of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. To him God is the centre of his life and in everything he does God is foremost for him. For St. Louis Marie de Montfort, all knowledge comes to nothing if one does not know God. Thus to know all things but not to know God is to know nothing at all.

On the top-right quadrant there is the sailboat at sea. It symbolizes that in life there will be struggle and mortification that we shall experience. Much like the ship at sea, we will come out the better if we are able to weather through the storms of life. No problem is too great to overcome and it is in perseverance and resilience that one shall be able to face all difficulties in life.

On the bottom-left quadrant there is the Star and the man in the boat. This symbolizes the Star of the sea, where seamen navigate to their destination in the vast ocean. If we are focused on the essential values of life, we shall reach our ultimate destiny in life. The Star of the sea shall be the guiding light that lights up the way in our life.

The Crest is adorned with green olive branches, which is derived from Ancient Greece, to symbolize peace and prosperity. It is thus the duty of each one to promote peace in the world, a peace that will last. Coupled with peace is that of prosperity which connotes not only the generation of wealth but also the integral development of human society. The Crest carries the Latin motto "Labor Omnia Vincit" which stands for "Labour conquers all things". Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

St Gabriel's boys, here on this day united<br>
With one true heart let us all sing and cheer<br>
The stately home where our boyhood is guided<br>
Learning to live and through right paths to steer<br>
In cheering blue and spotless white apparel<br>
A cheerful band, St Gabriel's boys unite!<br>
All white and blue, all bent to reap the laurel<br>
Hold and defend Alma Mater's Glory with heart and might

Chorus:<br>
Saint Gabriel's School dear<br>
Here willing hearts behold<br>
When duty's call rings clear<br>
Mid sorrows as through joys<br>
For Singapore and God<br>
For Justice to uphold<br>
Let us live and thus prove<br>
Saint Gabriel's boys.
