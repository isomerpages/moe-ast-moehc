#### **School History**
Serangoon Garden Secondary School began as Lichfield Secondary School, an English-medium school started in 1959. In the following year, the school was renamed Serangoon Garden Government High School, which offered both English and Chinese streams. Serangoon Garden Secondary School was established in 1969 when it absorbed the neighbouring school, Hwi Yoh Vocational School, and effectively became a bilingual school. 

Between 1965 and 1974, the school also offered two-year pre-university arts and science courses. In 1984, it became an English-medium school with the last batch of Chinese-stream students graduating in the same year. The pre-university programme ended in 1991. The school operated as single-session in 2000.

The year 2003 marked yet another milestone for Serangoon Garden Secondary School when it merged with Serangoon Garden Technical School to form the present school. The merged school moved to its current premises at Serangoon North Avenue 1 in March 2004.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme is in the domain of humanities, known as ‘Researching Society using Media Communication’. Its Learning for Life Programme is in the domain of community and youth leadership, known as ‘Nurturing Confident and Compassionate Leaders through Uniformed Groups’.

There is a strong culture of care and learning in the school as it is committed to the students’ holistic development. In 2015, Serangoon Garden Secondary won the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovation in the Normal Course. In the same year, the school celebrated its 55th anniversary.

The book symbolises the school’s aim to enable its students to achieve the highest level of academic achievement. The wheels represent the hope that students will be able to learn the diverse inter-related skills for lifelong learning in order to stay relevant in the face of constant change. The torch symbolises the bright future of students if they work hard and strive to do their best.
