#### **School History**
Hwa Chong Junior College (HCJC) was established in January 1974. It was Singapore’s second junior college, and the first government-aided junior college. As the school building was still under construction when lessons began, the students initially attended lessons at National Junior College and then at the NUS Bukit Timah campus. In June 1974, the staff and students moved into their new school building.

In 1980, Hwa Chong was chosen to be the centre for Oxbridge studies. In 1981, HCJC became the first junior college in Singapore to offer the Humanities programme.

Between June 1987 and December 1991, HCJC moved twice to temporary premises – first to Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Woodlands (June–December 1987), and then to Bukit Batok Street 34 (January 1988–December 1991) respectively. The school moved back to its newly renovated Bukit Timah campus on 29 December 1991.

Hwa Chong Junior College was one of the first junior colleges to offer the Chinese Language Elective Programme (C-LEP), when the course was introduced in 1990. In January 2004, it became the first junior college in Singapore to gain independent status.

On 1 January 2005, HCJC merged with The Chinese High School to become the integrated Hwa Chong Institution to facilitate the running of the school’s Integrated Programme.

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

As part of our glorious land, sharing her spreading fame,<br>
Hwa Chong will firmly stand, always to maintain her name.<br>
Multi-racial we study together, for knowledge we wish to attain.<br>
Many races we shall gather, each day to achieve its aim.<br>
We shall strive with verve, for health in body and mind.<br>
We'll learn to lead and yet to serve in character ruggedly fine.<br>
May Hwa Chong shine forever, her name big and strong,<br>
One and all, let’s stand by her, that she may live on and on.
