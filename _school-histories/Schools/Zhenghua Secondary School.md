#### **School History**
Zhenghua Secondary School was established in December 1999, temporarily operating from Greenridge Secondary School. In 2001, the school moved to 91 Senja Road.

In 2004, Zhenghua clinched the Ministry of Education’s Sustained Achievement Award for Uniformed Groups. In the following year, the school constructed its first-ever outdoor adventure facility, and has since added new features. The school’s Physical Education programme goes beyond instilling awareness for sports and physical activity among students, but inculcates a lifelong passion to maintain a healthy lifestyle. In 2014, the school began offering the Learning for Life Programme in outdoor education.

Since 2008, the school has developed several signature programmes to cultivate 21st-century skills amongst students. The interdisciplinary ‘E3: Explore, Experience, Engage’, started in 2017, is an inquiry-based learning approach to spark students’ curiosity, guide them in gathering data, and develop their reasoning and reflective thinking in authentic settings.  

In 2012, Zhenghua introduced a level-based signature programme, ‘The Sabbatical Week’, in which three days of curriculum time are set aside at the end of Term One for students to develop life skills, character traits and positive values.

In 2014, the Applied Learning Programme in game design and simulation and robotics was introduced to help students develop STEM(science, technology, engineering and mathematics)-related skills through authentic and practice-oriented learning experiences.

#### **School Motto**
Engage and Create

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/zhenghuasec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The letter ‘Z’ in white represents white water. It symbolises the continuous flow of knowledge and skills to be taught and learnt as well as the exuberance and vitality of youth. These skills equip every student to face fresh challenges in his or her adulthood. The slashed ‘Z’ signifies the impact that the students will make in the present and future.

The blue globe in the form of a stylised ‘H’ represents the global opportunities that are open to everyone who dares to accept the challenges beyond the confines of Singapore. The students will go global while remaining rooted to the country.

The colour red represents the plasma of life. The slashed ‘Z’ breaking out of its frame symbolises the need to break out of a mindset and its confines so that greater heights of achievement can be reached.
