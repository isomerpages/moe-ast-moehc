#### **School History**
Established in 1950, Playfair Primary School was located between Playfair Road and Burn Road. The school was housed in a single-storey building and had a school field. It offered morning and afternoon sessions.

The school eventually closed  in 1980 due to falling student enrolment. The school building was demolished and the land remained unoccupied for years. Since 2009, Trivex, a corporate office leasing company, has taken over the site.

\- Mr R. Balakrishnan (1950-1953)<br>
\- Mrs J. A. Rayney (January 1954 - May 1954)<br>
\- Mr R. S. Barth
