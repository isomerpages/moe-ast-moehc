#### **School History**
Established in 1950, Playfair Primary School was located between Playfair Road and Burn Road. The school&nbsp;was housed in a single-storey building and had a school field. It offered morning and afternoon sessions.

The school eventually closed &nbsp;in 1980 due to falling student enrolment. The school building was demolished and the land remained unoccupied for years. Since 2009, Trivex, a corporate office leasing company, has taken over the site.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr R. Balakrishnan (1950-1953)<br>
\- Mrs J. A. Rayney (January 1954 - May 1954)<br>
\- Mr R. S. Barth
