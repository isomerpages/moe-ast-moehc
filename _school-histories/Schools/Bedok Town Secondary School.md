#### **School History**
Bedok Town Secondary School started as Kaki Bukit Secondary School in 1965, providing education to children living in the rural area of Kaki Bukit. Officially opened on 27 May 1966, the school operated as a Malay and English-stream school. The school song, ‘Sekolah Menengah Kaki Bukit’, was written by Mr Zubir Said, the composer of Singapore’s national anthem. The school had been a prominent landmark in the _kampong_ (village) of Kaki Bukit, performing well academically and establishing a strong reputation in sepak takraw, football, hockey, athletics and cross-country.

In 1984, the school moved to a new campus in Bedok and was renamed Bedok Town Secondary School. It took on a new identity with updated school uniforms, flag, logo and motto. Bedok Town Secondary was officially opened on 21 August 1986. In 2007, the school became one of the three Normal (Technical) Mark II schools that piloted innovative Normal (Technical) programmes.

In 2011, the school merged with Chai Chee Secondary School, taking on the name of Bedok Town Secondary. The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015. In the following year, the school merged with Ping Yi Secondary, operating under the latter’s name.
