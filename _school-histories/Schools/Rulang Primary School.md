#### **School History**
Rulang Primary School started in 1930 as the Chinese-medium Joo Long Public School, located in a shophouse at 13½th milestone Jurong Road. It began as a small school to provide basic education for children from a village. In 1934, Joo Long Public School moved to Kee San Estate in Jalan Bahar to meet the need for bigger premises. Students were taught English as a second language. The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation from 1941 to 1945 and left in ruins. In 1950, the school celebrated its 21st anniversary by moving into a newly built spacious school on Upper Jurong Road.

In 1957, Joo Long Public School became a government-aided school. In 1959, the school expanded to cater to the rise in population in Jurong. In 1979, pre-primary classes started in the school. In 1981, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary with a grand concert and dinner attended by over a thousand guests.&nbsp;

In 1984, Joo Long Public School was renamed Rulang Primary School when it became a government school. In the following year, Rulang Primary relocated to its present premises at 6 Jurong West Street 52. The school was officially opened on 21 November 1986.

In 1993, Rulang Primary School was selected to champion the infusion of technology in its curriculum. Since 2008, the school has been offering robotics as a distinctive programme to its students, and robotics is now recognised as the Applied Learning Programme for the school.

In 2018, the school completed the PERI upgrading. The following year, the school became a single-session school with a Student Care Centre within the school.

Hail, Alma mater Rulang School<br>
May you stand like an evergreen<br>
To spread culture and develop talents<br>
To teach the ways of scholars<br>
And make us see<br>
The importance of respect for others<br>
The toil and sweat of our fathers<br>
We'll never forget<br>
The advice of friends and teachers<br>
We're sure to remember<br>
With you we march forward courageously<br>
With time<br>
We progress together zealously
