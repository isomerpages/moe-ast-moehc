#### **School History**
Established in 1926, Telok Kurau East Primary School was initially known as Telok Kurau English School. The school building was a two-storey wooden structure situated at Telok Kurau Road. Additionally, the school was an all-boys school.  
  
In the 1960s, two new schools were built in the vicinity of Telok Kurau English School. These schools were Telok Kurau Malay Girls’ School, established in 1960, and Telok Kurau West School, established in 1962. In 1962, Telok Kurau English School’s name was changed to Telok Kurau East Primary School in order to distinguish itself from these new schools.&nbsp;  
  
In 1967, a new school building for Telok Kurau East Primary School was built at Joo Chiat Place. This new school building was declared open by then Member of Parliament for Kampong Chai Chee, Mr Sha'ari Tadin on 19 March 1968. Furthermore, the first batch of female students joined Telok Kurau East Primary School in 1968.&nbsp;  
  
In 1983, Telok Kurau Malay Girls' School and Telok Kurau West School merged. In 1985, this amalgamated school merged with Telok Kurau East School to form Telok Kurau Primary School. In 2001, Telok Kurau Primary School merged with Bedok Town Primary School, while retaining the name of the former. The new Telok Kurau Primary School relocated to Bedok Reservoir Road, where it remains till today.&nbsp;  
  
Since 2001, the former site of Telok Kurau East Primary School has been home to various arts schools such as MuzArt East Coast Art School and Wufang Singapore Martial Arts School.

To school we come merrily.<br>
Feeling like one family,<br>
Rain or shine in school we will be,<br>
Getting on with work and play.<br>
