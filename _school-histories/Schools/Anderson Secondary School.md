#### **School History**
Founded as a primary school in 1960, Anderson became a secondary girls’ school in 1964 and a co-educational school in 1965. The school was relocated from Stevens Road to Ang Mo Kio Street 44 in 1984, and then to its present premises at Ang Mo Kio Street 53 in 1993. Anderson Secondary School was one of the first six autonomous schools in 1994, which allowed the principals to have greater autonomy in school leadership.  

The Anderson-Winitsuksa Student Exchange Programme was introduced in 1998 as part of the efforts to promote bilateral ties between Singapore and Thailand.

The Science Research Programme was established as the school’s niche in 2000 and is aligned to the national direction to develop Singapore into a biomedical sciences hub. In 2005, Anderson Secondary was accorded the status of Cluster Centre of Excellence for Science as a result of its contribution to science research education and service to the community.

The school currently offers the Science Research Programme and the Basic Coding Enrichment Programme, with a focus on experiential learning in the academic and non-academic curriculum. The Elective Programme in Malay Language in Secondary Schools provides opportunities for the students to develop a deeper appreciation of the Malay language and culture.

**The March of The Andersonians**

Ever onward, Andersonians<br>
Always ready to go<br>
With constancy and purpose<br>
To failure we’ll say “No”<br>
Progress is what we aim for<br>
Success is in our sight<br>
So marching forward, and never backward<br>
Our future will be bright

Ever onward, Andersonians<br>
We’ll be loyal and true<br>
And not forgetting our Alma Mater<br>
In everything we do<br>
Steadfast and always active<br>
In work and in our play<br>
So striving for a spotless reputation<br>
We’ll keep it that way.
