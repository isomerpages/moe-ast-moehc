#### **School History**
The former Yishun Primary School was the first primary school to be built in Yishun New Town. Established in 1982 and located at 551 Yishun Ring Road, the school started with 200 students in 10 classes. Most of the students were originally from Sembawang Primary School and Si San Public School. The school was officially opened on 14 September 1984.

At the end of 2008, Yishun Primary School started a new era when the school merged with Peixin Primary School, which had been founded in 1985. The merger saw the forging of two unique school cultures and the birth of the new Yishun Primary School at its current premises, 500 Yishun Ring Road. The new campus was officially declared open on 1 July 2011.

At the end of 2014, the school’s efforts in teaching its students the importance of caring for the environment was recognised by the Ministry of Education – it was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Environmental Science Education. The Ministry also recognised the school’s modular approach in exposing and developing its students in performing arts by according it the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Viva De Symphonie – Championing Values: Living, Learning and Growing Through Music’.

The school’s performing arts groups have received accolades in several national competitions and have been invited to perform at various Ministry functions such as the 2013 Workplan Seminar and the pre-parade segment of the 2013 National Day Parade. In 2015, 30 students participated in the Opening Ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games; held in Singapore. In addition, the concert band also performed at the opening of the SG50 public exhibition “Good Morning ‘Cher: Our Schools, Our Teachers, Our Stories”.

Yishun Primary School continues to provide its students with a broad-based holistic education to develop independent, engaged learners who are caring and confident citizens.
