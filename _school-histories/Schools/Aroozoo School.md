#### **School History**
Established in 1963, Aroozoo Primary School was located at Aroozoo Avenue, off Upper Serangoon Road.  
  
In 1991, Aroozoo Primary School merged with neighbouring Charlton School. The newly amalgamated Charlton School occupied the former campuses of Aroozoo Primary School and Charlton School. In 2003, Charlton School merged with Xinghua Primary School and shifted to the site of Xinghua Primary School. Since 2004, the former sites of Aroozoo Primary School and Charlton School have been used as the DPS International School.

#### **School Song**
We are very proud of Aroozoo<br>
Where we’ve set our life’s hopes bright<br>
Where we learn to be strong, just and true<br>
And at all times do the right
  
Oh our school that teaches us to give<br>
Of our best in all we do<br>
For our nation, we’re readied to live<br>
Yes, we love our Aroozoo
  
We are loyal to our Aroozoo<br>
For she cares for us always<br>
She makes us work hard and play hard too<br>
At the proper time and place
