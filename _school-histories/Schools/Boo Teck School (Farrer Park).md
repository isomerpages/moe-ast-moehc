#### **School History**
Boo Teck School was established by Nanyang Sim Clan Association in 1955. In 1959, the school shifted to a new location at Beatty Road to accommodate its growing student population.  
  
Over time, enrolment declined, and Boo Teck School closed in 1981. Since 1988, Wu De Building, a residential complex, has occupied the former site of the school.
