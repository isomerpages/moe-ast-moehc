#### **School History**
Situated in the eastern part of Singapore, Meridian Junior College (Meridian JC) was established in 2003. Its name was derived from the winning entry in a school-naming competition. ‘Meridian’ refers to a line in astronomy that measures the highest point that a star reaches as it journeys across the night sky. It also means the point of highest achievement and greatest splendour. Thus, the name ‘Meridian’ aptly painted the image of the college’s vision for itself.

Soon after construction was completed, and before the first batch of students arrived, the staff embarked on the college’s first envisioning retreat to carve out its vision, mission and values.

On 25 February 2005, the college hosted its official opening ceremony, and the inaugural College Day was held on 23 July that same year.

Over the years, the college had built a name for itself as both an institution with academic distinction and a co-curricular activity powerhouse, excelling in sports, performing arts and other areas.

Anchored by the values of courage, purpose and character, Meridian JC lived true to its name and mission of cultivating learned men and women of calibre who have the heart and will to lead and serve in a challenging world.

In 2019, Tampines JC and Meridian JC were merged to form Tampines Meridian JC.

Principals:<br>
\- Ms Esther Lai (2003–2014)<br>
\- Mr Lim Yan Hock (2015–2018)

The fluid design of the roaring lion projects the image of a dynamic institution that is swift in embracing the challenges of a fast-changing world.

Born of a vision to be the best<br>
Rising above the rest<br>
We speak with one clear voice<br>
As this is our choice…<br>
 ‘Cause we’re

Born of a vision to be the best<br>
Rising above the rest<br>
We speak with one clear voice<br>
Yes this is our choice<br>
Meridian, yes we will be the best

Feel the flame of our dream, burn forever<br>
As our journey here begins<br>
We’re together<br>
With each step we take we know<br>
Strength to strength we’ll grow<br>
As we set ourselves apart

Facing challenges ahead<br>
We will overcome<br>
With passion, fervour we will strive<br>
Spread our wings and fly<br>
We will reach the highest star<br>
Through Meridian<br>
Yes, our hopes and dreams will shine

Born of a vision to be the best<br>
Rising above the rest<br>
We speak with one clear voice<br>
As this is our choice…<br>
‘Cause we’re

Born of a vision to be the best<br>
Rising above the rest<br>
We speak with one clear voice<br>
Yes this is our choice<br>
Meridian, yes we will be the best
