Jurongville Secondary School was established in 1994 as a government co-educational school, operating at the site of Commonwealth Secondary School. In 1996, the school relocated to its present premises at 202 Jurong East Avenue 1.&nbsp;

In 2002, the school opened its Cluster Science Learning Centre. Two years later, it celebrated its 10th anniversary. In 2011, the school completed PRIME upgrading.

#### **School Motto**
Beyond Self

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/jurongvillesec1.png">

The English (Jurongville) and Chinese (Hong Kah) names featured in the new school crest signify the contributions from the students, staff and stakeholders of both constituent school communities. Set against a globe, the two leaves represent the students and their growth in a nurturing school environment. The globe represents the school’s aspiration to help all students acquire the values, knowledge and skills necessary to thrive and live meaningfully in Singapore and beyond.
