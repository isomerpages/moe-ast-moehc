#### **School Motto**
Beyond Self

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/jurongvillesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The English (Jurongville) and Chinese (Hong Kah) names featured in the new school crest signify the contributions from the students, staff and stakeholders of both constituent school communities. Set against a globe, the two leaves represent the students and their growth in a nurturing school environment. The globe represents the school’s aspiration to help all students acquire the values, knowledge and skills necessary to thrive and live meaningfully in Singapore and beyond.

We are the students from Jurongville<br>
Our school our alma mater<br>
We stand united as we pledge<br>
To give our best to Jurongville

Our school crest symbolises growth<br>
Reminding us as we mature<br>
Though each of us may be unique<br>
In spirit we share but one aim

We’ll always serve with steadfastness<br>
And honour her ideal<br>
To be committed and responsible<br>
And give beyond ourselves with zeal

And with truth as our guiding light<br>
We’ll bravely venture forth<br>
To answer every worthwhile call<br>
And do our best for one and all

We are the students from Jurongville<br>
Our school our alma mater<br>
We stand united as we pledge<br>
To give our best to Jurongville
