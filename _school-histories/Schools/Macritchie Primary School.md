#### **School History**
MacRitchie Primary School was officially opened on 8th March 1977 by then Member of Parliament for Toa Payoh, Mr Eric Cheong. The school began as an integrated school offering English and Chinese language streams. Most students in the school’s English medium stream were from Whitley Primary School, which closed in 1975.  Students in the Chinese medium stream were mainly from Nam Ann Primary School, which closed in the same year. Additionally, MacRitchie Primary School shared a school field with Braddell Primary School. 

In 1997, MacRitchie Primary School closed.

 The MacRitchie school badge is made up of a simple yet meaningful design. <br>
The torch symbolises the ever burning quest for knowledge and the stripes depict the rungs on the ladder of success. The letter M is the intial of the name of the school.<br>
There are two main colours, white for purity and green to express constant freshness. The colours and their meanings coupled with the simple motto.<br>
WORK FOR SUCCESS expresses the very spirit of MacRitchie.<br>
