&nbsp;The MacRitchie school badge is made up of a simple yet meaningful design.&nbsp;<br>
The torch symbolises the ever burning quest for knowledge and the stripes depict the rungs on the ladder of success. The letter M is the intial of the name of the school.<br>
There are two main colours, white for purity and green to express constant freshness. The colours and their meanings coupled with the simple motto.<br>
WORK FOR SUCCESS expresses the very spirit of MacRitchie.<br>
