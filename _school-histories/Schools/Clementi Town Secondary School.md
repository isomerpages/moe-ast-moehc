#### **School History**
Clementi Town Secondary School was established in 1980 in the heart of Clementi. Students are endearingly referred to as Clementeens.

The school’s roots in computing were planted early in 1994, when the Apple Macintosh Computer laboratory was set up after it was selected to be a pilot school for the Smart Classroom Project. Subsequently, the school launched its IT (information technology) Masterplan in 1997.

In 2008, the school completed its PRIME upgrading; the event was celebrated with a school-wide walk back to its Clementi campus from the holding site in Commonwealth. Committed to its aim to develop students’ passions. In 2009, the school began its biennial musical journey, where students and alumni stage a musical production together. The first musical was "To Kill a Mockingbird".

In 2015, the school celebrated its 35th anniversary through four key events: the planting of a time capsule that will be unearthed when the school turns 50 in 2030; a combined aesthetics concert; a homecoming dinner; and the CT Shoes4Soles event, where the school collected and distributed shoes to the needy.

In the same year, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Leadership through Uniformed Groups’.

#### **School Motto**
Aspire & Grow

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/clementitownsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The initials ‘CTS’ feature on the school crest. The letter ‘T’ is in the form of a stylised tree with four layers of leaves. Each layer becomes narrower as it ascends, to denote the idea of growth and aspiration. The school motto is in bold black lettering. The colour green is used for the basic design of the initials, to symbolise growth. White is used for the background to symbolise purity.

We are one big family<br>

With a true spirit and with zeal<br>
Diligence and loyalty<br>
Together we grow in wisdom, strength and unity

We pledge to uphold your name<br>
From each his best and yet as one<br>
We'll strive to aspire and grow<br>

In all endeavours we’ll work hard<br>
In lessons or sports or in music<br>
Skills and good traits to be acquired<br>
Not forgetting humility<br>
For country and nation –<br>
