#### **School History**
Established in 1952, Havelock Primary School was located at Ganges Avenue and was once initially known as Havelock Road School In its early years, the school catered to students who lived in the nearby Bukit Ho Swee estate.  
  
Over time, the school’s enrolment fell. By 1982, the school only had 667 students. Havelock Primary School closed down in 1984 and its remaining 520 students subsequently joined Delta Primary School in the same year. The former site of Havelock Primary School was occupied by the Boys’ Brigade Headquarters and Training Centre from 1985 to 2021.
