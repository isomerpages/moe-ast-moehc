#### **School History**
Serangoon Garden Technical School was established at the beginning of 1964 with about 1,200 in 30 classes. Located at Burghley Drive in the Serangoon Garden estate, the school offered technical and academic classes in two language streams, English and Chinese. The school was officially declared open on 18 July 1964.

In 1973, when the centralised scheme for technical education was introduced, students from nearby schools attended lessons for technical subjects at Serangoon Garden Technical School.

The school had a very active St John Ambulance Brigade unit. From 1996 to 1998, the unit won the championship in the Zonal First Aid and Home Nursing Competition. In 1997, the unit also attained the First Aid Championship as well as the second runner-up (Overall Performance) in the National First Aid and Home Nursing Competition.

In 2003, Serangoon Garden Technical School merged with Serangoon Garden Secondary School.
