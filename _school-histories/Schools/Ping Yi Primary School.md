In January 1997, Ping Yi Primary implemented the Learning Support Programme (LSP), which focused on helping primary one students overcome their learning difficulties, as well as the Underachievers’ Programme, which helped students who were underperforming.

In 2001, Ping Yi Primary merged with Fengshan Primary School.
