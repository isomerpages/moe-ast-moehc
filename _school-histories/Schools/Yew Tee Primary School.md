#### **School Motto**
Excellence with Integrity

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/yewteepri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest shows two Chinese characters ‘Yu Zhi’, which means ‘nurturing young minds’. The book represents knowledge and wisdom. The shield, used in olden times by knights, symbolises the integrity and moral ethical values of the bearers. The banner and three arrows symbolise success and achievements beyond academic accomplishments. The entwined arrows symbolise creativity, the flaming torch stands for achievements in sports and co-curricular activities, while the handshake and heart represent racial harmony and care for others.
