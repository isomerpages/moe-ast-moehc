#### **School History**
Qifa Primary School was established in 1906 as Khee Fatt Study Institution (启发学堂) by the Char Yong (Dabu) Association, which was made up of early Hakka immigrants from China. The school moved from its first location at Loke Yew Street to Peking Street following an increase in enrolment. By 1937, the school had expanded and relocated to Hill Street. The school stopped functioning temporarily during the Japanese Occupation.

Khee Fatt Study Institution was renamed Khee Fatt School and resumed operations at 30 Cairnhill Road in 1947. To accommodate the growing student population, the school began an expansion project that was finally completed in 1966. The new school was officially opened on 13 October 1966.

In 1984, Khee Fatt School became an English-medium government school and was renamed Qifa Primary School. In 1985, the school relocated to its current site at 50 West Coast Avenue. Qifa Primary School was officially opened on 18 September 1987.

In 1997, Jubilee Primary School joined Qifa Primary School when the former was closed down. In 2006, the school underwent PRIME upgrading. In 2008, Jin Tai Primary School merged with Qifa Primary School. In 2012, the school underwent PERI upgrading to equip the school with an enhanced physical environment to better support students’ learning.

In 2011, the school was selected for the Programme for School-based Excellence Award for Volleyball. The school’s Effective Communication Programme was recognised by the Ministry of Education as an Applied Learning Programme in 2014. In 2016, the school reviewed and repositioned its niche – from ‘Nurturing Leaders of Character and Healthy Individuals through Volleyball’ to the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Character Moulding Programme through Sports (CHAMPS) @Qifa’.

#### **School Motto**
Strive to Excel

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/qifapri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The emblem of the tree, which forms the central motif of the school crest, represents enduring strength and growth. The tree provides shelter and sustenance, signifying the school’s desire to provide a safe environment where all can thrive as they seek to realise the school vision: ‘An Achieving School with a Caring Environment’. The roots that spread out symbolise stability and the laying of a strong foundation to equip students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to blossom and bear fruit as the school name ‘启发’  suggests.
