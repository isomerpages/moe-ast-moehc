The central symbol, in the form of a directional arrow, epitomises the students’ spirit of working creatively and unyieldingly to excel. The three rings symbolise the close collaborative efforts of parents, students and teachers to enable the students to reach and excel. The logo exhorts the students to push themselves to the utmost limit of their potential and strive for excellence.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Here where we are nurtured<br>
And tended with loving care<br>
That we may grow from day to day<br>
Hardy, resilient, persevering, wise<br>
Whether at work or play<br>
We'll be the best in every way

Chorus:<br>
Youthful and vigorous<br>
BPS will always be<br>
BPSians, come on strive<br>
To reach and excel<br>
Towards greater heights

Imbue us with virtue<br>
Help us be sincere<br>
Let's be courteous and respectful<br>
Generous, caring our commitments too<br>
Come pledge honour and loyalty<br>
To our school and our country

Chorus
