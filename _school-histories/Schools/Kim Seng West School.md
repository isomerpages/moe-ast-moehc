#### **School History**
Kim Seng West School was established in the early 1950s.  
  
During the 1961 Bukit Ho Swee Fire incident, Kim Seng West School was used as a temporary relief centre.  
  
In 1982, the school merged with Kim Seng East School to form Kim Seng Primary School. In 1985, Kim Seng Primary School merged with River Valley Government Chinese School and River Valley English School to form River Valley Primary School.  
  
Kim Seng West Schoolâ€™s building then became the Ministry of Manpower Employment Inspectorate building for several years. Subsequently, the site was used for the construction of the Great World MRT Station.
