#### **School History**
Woodlands Ring Secondary School (WRSS) was established in 1998 as a government co-educational school at 10 Woodlands Ring Road. The school received its first batch of 395 Secondary One students on 2 January 1998, with 15 teachers. Today, the school population stands at 1,148 students with 105 teaching staff.

As Woodlands Ring Secondary is located in the then rapidly expanding Woodlands housing estate, it operated as a holding school for several other schools: Woodlands Ring Primary School from January to July 1998, Evergreen Primary from January to March 1999, Sembawang Secondary School from January to Auguest 1999 and Orchid Park Secondary School from January to August 1999.

The school celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2008. In the following year, WRSS was recognised as a niche school in robotics. In 2015, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘The Robotics Education and Enterprise’ (TREE). The programme aims to instill in students a curiosity to learn through experimentation, questioning, risk-taking and mistake-making. It also develops students’ ability to make connections with real-life problems, encourages collaboration in co-constructing knowledge and problem-solving. To allow students to further extend their learning, the school started offering the Ministry of Education (MOE)-Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Applied Subject – Mobile Robotics – to Secondary Three Normal (Technical) students from 2017. Electronics, an MOE-Applied Subject for Secondary Three Express students, was launched in 2019. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Leveraging on the strengths of its Student Leadership Development Programme, WRSS was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Student Leadership Development through Involvement in the Community’, in 2016. The programme hopes to instill in students the desire to care for and lead others in the community, as well as to strengthen their understanding and appreciation of the spirit of being compassionate towards the less privileged in society. Through various projects, the programme enables students to maximise their potential in the moral and social domains and contribute selflessly to society, as encapsulated in the school philosophy.

In 2018, WRSS celebrated its 21st anniversary. With a team of dedicated and reflective staff, the school is committed to a continual journey of nurturing students to be worthy, resilient and selfless.&nbsp;&nbsp;

#### **School Motto**
Work, Rise, Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/woodlandsringsec1.jpg">

The school emblem forms the initials of the school, ‘WRSS’. It projects the spirit of growth, strength and the endless search for knowledge for a brighter future. The letter ‘W’ is in the shape of a pair of hands, signifying the firm and warm support for growth and the potential of every student. The letter ‘R’ is represented by the ring encompassing the five-pointed star. It symbolises a bright, balanced and wholesome person nurtured in a warm and caring environment. Each point of the star represents a dimension of growth – cognitive, physical, social, moral and aesthetic. The double ‘SS’ is stylised as the flame of knowledge, which illuminates the path of the rising star to carry on the firm traditions of the school’s pioneering spirit.

The colour red represents dynamism and strength, the passion to rise and succeed. Green is the colour of growth and development, while golden yellow symbolises the rays of the sun that radiate hope, wisdom and warmth.

Growing up, what wonders we behold!<br>
Like butterflies from cocoons we unfold<br>
From childhood into the splendor and beauty of youth<br>
Growing grace and wisdom, embracing truth

Beloved school, it’s here where we belong<br>
And learn to be humane responsible<br>
Upright and independent thinkers we become<br>
Through the care and guidance of our teachers

Chorus:<br>
Woodlands Ring Secondary School<br>
You teach us a wondrous thing:<br>
Work, Rise and Serve mankind in sincerity<br>
Selflessly contribute to society

Each of us, unique with talents bold<br>
To be developed through your guidance gold<br>
We are worthy and thoroughly resilient too<br>
We will do our best our beloved school

(Repeat Chorus)

Selflessly contribute to society.
