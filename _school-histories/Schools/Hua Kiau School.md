#### **School History**
Established in 1931, Hua Kiau School was a Chinese-medium school. Initially, the school was located on the first floor of a shophouse at Pasir Panjang Lane. In 1940, the school moved to an attap building along the now-defunct Bakau Lane. Hua Kiau School then shifted to a two-storey building further down Bakau Lane.  
  
In 1960, the school moved to Pasir Panjang Hill, located off Pasir Panjang Road. The new school building had 26 classrooms and could accommodate 1400 students.  
  
Hua Kiau School's enrolment was low due to residents moving to new towns. The school closed down in 1981.  
  
In 1983, the building of Hua Kiau School was renovated and occupied by the Colombo Plan Staff College. After the College moved out of the site in 1986, the former building of the school has been occupied by private estate houses.
