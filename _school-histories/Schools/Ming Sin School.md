<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Established in 1950, Ming Sin School was located at Wolskel Road. Ming
Sin School’s history dates back to pre-war times. Prior to its establishment
as an official primary school in 1950, the school was located at Bukit
Arang Road and operated under the administration of Bethel Presbyterian
Church. The school had functioned as a kampung Chinese school. Additionally,
Ming Sin School’s building was used as a shelter during the Japanese Occupation.</p>
<p>After the war, Ming Sin School moved to Wolskel Road and was officially
established in 1950. In 1965, Ming Sin School’s site also housed Li Sun
High School. Over time, enrolment rates declined and Ming Sin School closed
in 1984.</p>
