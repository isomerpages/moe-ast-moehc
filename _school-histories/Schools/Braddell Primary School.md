#### **School Motto**
Rise And Shine

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/braddellpri1.png">

The&nbsp;**circle**&nbsp;portrays total commitment and perfection in the various school activities. The&nbsp;**triangle**&nbsp;with the apex pointing upwards reflects the continual strive for progress.

The&nbsp;**torch**&nbsp;reminds students of the burning desire to acquire knowledge and skills and the total commitment in the field of sports.

The&nbsp;**three**&nbsp;**broad lines**&nbsp;indicate the three main languages taught in the school, namely English, Chinese and Tamil.

The colour&nbsp;**grey**&nbsp;is the principal colour of the school and&nbsp;**red**&nbsp;signifies a young school.

The&nbsp;**motto**&nbsp;“Rise And Shine” is from the famous play&nbsp;_The Glass Menagerie_, in which the mother wakes her son up each morning with the cheerful exhortation, “Rise and Shine”. In Braddell Primary, the students are urged to rise and shine not only in the physical sense but also in the metaphorical sense of shining in the behavioural, academic, athletic and other aspects of school life.

#### **School Song**
We the children of Braddell Primary school<br>
All pledge our loyalty to our school<br>
We love our school just as our home<br>
May it ever prosper and become well-known

Oh Braddellites rise and shine<br>
Shine in studies, work and play<br>
Shine by words and action kinds<br>
And be cheerful, courteous everyday
