#### **School History**
Dunearn Secondary School started as Dunearn Government Chinese Middle School in 1962 in a campus atop the hill at Hillcrest Avenue along Dunearn Road. The Chinese-medium school merged with the English-stream Dunearn Vocational School to become Dunearn Secondary School in 1969, providing education in both Chinese and English, as well as academic and technical courses. The distinct cultures and languages of the merged school of 3,000 students at the time gradually amalgamated to function as ‘one school, one family’, forming a strong, solid and unified school community.

The school offered pre-university commerce and arts courses in the 1980s until its move from Bukit Timah to its present premises at 21 Bukit Batok West Avenue 2 in 1993. That same year saw the formation of the Dunearn Secondary School Alumni.

In the new millennium, the school grew from strength to strength in its efforts to provide a holistic education, as shown by the National Police Cadet Corps attaining the Gold Unit Overall Proficiency Award for 11 consecutive years. In 2014, Dunearn Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in food science and technology. The programme aims to provide exposure to STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)-related applied learning and careers to help ignite students’ interest in pursuing STEM-related post-secondary courses, and eventually to STEM-related careers. In that same year, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in community youth leadership. The school seeks to provide every Dunearnite opportunities to lead in serving the community. Students also acquire the knowledge, skills and attitudes to be personal leaders, team leaders and thoughtful leaders via the Cohort Student Leadership Syllabus and Differentiated Student Leadership Syllabus.

From 2016 to 2018, the school building underwent PRIME upgrading to modernise its facilities in order to support the school’s programmes. The design of the new campus successfully preserved the school’s heritage. While the contemporary facade of the new campus is grand and inviting, the iconic elements of the old campus were retained and they integrate well with the new elements. This campus marks a fresh chapter for Dunearn Secondary School, which is built on the foundation of over 50 years of history and heritage through the efforts of the staff, alumni, School Advisory Committee and the wider school community.

#### **School Motto**
Determined and Disciplined

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/dunearnsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Originally designed by Mr Ang Oo Seng, one of the school’s longest-serving pioneer teachers, the stylised flame in the centre of the badge symbolises the school as a place of learning and enlightenment. The flame also subtly depicts the letters ‘DSS’, which stand for the school name. The three panels forming the background represent the support given by School Advisory Committee members, staff, and parents of the students. The polished diamond represents each student of Dunearn developed to his/her full potential.

The three school colours of red, blue and gold stand respectively for the passion and enthusiasm for learning; discipline and steadfastness in character; and the ultimate target of the school’s endeavours.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

As I enter Dunearn’s gates<br>
My heart swells up<br>
With pride and hope<br>
This is where I work and play<br>
It’s the place that helps me grow

Determined and disciplined<br>
Our watchwords for success<br>
We will always do our best<br>
To bring glory to our school

In Dunearn we care and share with one another<br>
We strive to gain knowledge and skills<br>
We face all challenges<br>
We endure all pressures<br>
Overcome all obstacles<br>
United as a team<br>
From Dunearn we will emerge responsible and confident<br>
We’re determined and disciplined<br>
We’re Dunearn!
