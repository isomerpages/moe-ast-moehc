#### **School History**
Springfield Secondary School was established on 21 December 1992 as Tampines West Secondary School. The school moved to its present premises at Tampines Avenue 8 in June 1993.

September 1995 saw the official opening of the school together with its Rock Wall, which became a distinguishing physical feature of Springfield and also the focal point of its flagship programme, rock climbing. In 1998, recognising the need to develop a caring spirit in all Springfielders, Operation Beacon 1, a community service project, was initiated. In this initiative, the school brought members of the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped on a climb up Mount Kinabalu. The project set a precedent for future collaborations with the community.

In 2008, Springfield was awarded niche status for its rock climbing programme, which aims to develop students with an adventurous and rugged spirit. At the same time, the school continued to strengthen its ties with the community. Springfield collaborated with the Tampines West Community Club to organise GIFT II (Games Involving Fitness and Teamwork). The school also expanded its service to the Tampines community through its partnership with Evergreen Circle and the Tampines Grove Garden.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Health Sciences through SP2A.The ALP is infused into subjects such as Science, Food and Consumer Education, and Physical Education. This integration allows students to see the connections and applications of the ALP in various subjects and helps to ignite the students’ passion and interest in STEM. The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), also accorded that same year, is in community and youth leadership. It aims to create awareness of community issues, equip students with leadership competencies and empower them to lead and mentor in values-in-action experiences. These experiences invoke the spirit of volunteerism and passion for social causes in students as they continue to lead and initiate community support to help make Singapore a gracious and more caring society. Since its inception, the programme has evolved from being predominantly teacher-led to one that involves student-led projects, adapting accordingly to allow student leaders to apply the leadership skills they have learnt from the programme. There are also opportunities for small groups of students to initiate their own projects for causes they wish to support.

The school’s ALP and LLP exemplify the school’s commitment to the holistic development of students and preparing them for life beyond secondary education.

In 2017, Springfield Secondary celebrated its 25th anniversary.

#### **School Motto**
Better Self for Better Tomorrow

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/springfieldsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The blade of green grass forms the letter ‘S’, while the glowing sun, together with the green grass, forms the letter ‘f’. The three rows of rich, golden earth provide the foundation; together, they represent Springfield Secondary School. The grass is also shaped like a hand, which symbolises the tender care by which the school nurtures students to become wholesome adults.
