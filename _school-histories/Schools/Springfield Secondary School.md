#### **School History**

Springfield Secondary School was established on 21 December 1992 as Tampines West Secondary School. The school moved to its present premises at Tampines Avenue 8 in June 1993.

September 1995 saw the official opening of the school together with its Rock Wall, which became a distinguishing physical feature of Springfield and also the focal point of its flagship programme, rock climbing. In 1998, recognising the need to develop a caring spirit in all Springfielders, Operation Beacon 1, a community service project, was initiated. In this initiative, the school brought members of the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped on a climb up Mount Kinabalu. The project set a precedent for future collaborations with the community.

In 2008, Springfield was awarded niche status for its rock climbing programme, which aims to develop students with an adventurous and rugged spirit. At the same time, the school continued to strengthen its ties with the community. Springfield collaborated with the Tampines West Community Club to organise GIFT II (Games Involving Fitness and Teamwork). The school also expanded its service to the Tampines community through its partnership with Evergreen Circle and the Tampines Grove Garden.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in ‘Health Sciences'. The programme provides students with authentic learning experiences in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields and opportunities to apply knowledge and skills across different subject domains. Through these, the school aims to develop innovative and critical-thinking learners who are able to ideate and propose solutions to real-world problems in STEM-related contexts.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), also accorded that same year, is in Community and Youth Leadership (CYL), which is centred around the school’s values of Graciousness, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity and Diligence. It aims to cultivate a pervasive Community Youth Leadership (CYL) culture by instilling in students the importance of social responsibility and volunteerism. This is achieved through a progressive tiered-approach (G.E.A.R) where students are provided with platforms at cohort or group level to learn and develop skills and knowledge. The G.E.A.R approach (Grounded in Values; Engaged to Learn and Lead; Aspire to Serve; Ready to Soar) articulates the area of focus for each cohort of students, and specialized programmes are planned according to the respective areas of focus.

The school’s ALP and LLP exemplify the school’s commitment to the holistic development of students and preparing them for life beyond secondary education.

In 2019, the MOE established UPLIFT (Uplifting Pupils in Life and Inspiring Families Taskforce), a national initiative aimed at addressing problems faced by underperforming students from disadvantaged families. To support students in line with UPLIFT’s ongoing efforts, the school created the Educational Support Committee. The committee's approach involves identifying and monitoring Springfielders through a data-driven process, designing customised programmes, developing staff competency, and strengthening community partnerships.

In 2017, Springfield Secondary celebrated its 25th anniversary with a literary theme “A New Page, A New Chapter”. On Speech Day, the school celebrated the opening of its newly renovated library and the unveiling of the Environment Pledge Banner. The latter was part of the school’s Project Green Pledge as a promise by the school to reduce its carbon footprint in 2017 and beyond. To create the banner, the school, together with its partner organisations, community partners and parents, imprinted their thumbprint as a promise to commit to the cause. The culmination of Springfield’s Project Green efforts was being listed in the Singapore Book of Records for creating Singapore's largest logo made of thumbprints!

Five years later, Springfield celebrated its 30th anniversary, with the theme ‘Reminisce the Past, Celebrate the Present, Explore the Future’. The year-long celebration took the form of curated lessons to provide the global and local contexts of life for Springfield and our Springfielders, as well as laud its milestones across the years. A key event of the Pearl Anniversary was the official launch of The Usual Place (TUP), as part Springfield’s education support programme to provide a safe and inviting physical space to conduct after-school activities. In addition, a special anniversary song was composed by the school’s music teacher, Ms Lim Jia Jing.

Better Self for Better Tomorrow

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/springfieldsec1.jpg">

The blade of green grass forms the letter ‘S’, while the glowing sun, together with the green grass, forms the letter ‘f’. The three rows of rich, golden earth provide the foundation; together, they represent Springfield Secondary School. The grass is also shaped like a hand, which symbolises the tender care by which the school nurtures students to become wholesome adults.
