Established in 1966, Farrer Primary School was located on Lutheran Road, off Bukit Timah Road. The school was officially opened by Mr Lee Teck Him, then Member of Parliament for Ulu Pandan, on 4 June 1968. The school originally offered English, Chinese, and Malay streams. Later, it became an English-medium school and offered Chinese, Malay and Tamil as Mother Tongue Languages.

The school campus was used by Nanyang Primary School for its Primary One and Two students from 1993 to 1999 The building was then used as the Singapore International Campus, a hostel for international students, from 2010 to 2015. Several years later, the campus was used for another hostel known as Lutheran Student Hostel, which has continued to occupy the site till today.
