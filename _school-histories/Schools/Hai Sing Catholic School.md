#### **School History**
The Franciscan Missionaries of Mary sisters, under the leadership of Sister Theresa Tsang, founded Hai Sing Girls’ High School in 1959. It started as a Chinese-medium school in Serangoon, present-day Hougang. With an enrolment of 170 female students, it held lessons at CHIJ Punggol Convent, a primary school.

In 1960, construction of a three-storey school at 7¼-mile Upper Serangoon began, and it was completed in the following year. The student population increased and a new 800-seat school hall was added in 1972. In 1978, Hai Sing Girls’ High School was named as one of the 14 outstanding Chinese secondary schools in Singapore. 

Following changes in the education landscape, Hai Sing Girls’ High School moved with the times. In 1981, it began taking in students from the English stream and converted from a Chinese-medium school to an integrated school offering both Chinese and English streams.

The year 1990 was momentous for the school. In January, the school became co-educational, taking in male students as well as students of other races, which led to its renaming as Hai Sing High School. In March, the school moved to a new school building in Pasir Ris. To reflect its Catholic mission, the school was renamed Hai Sing Catholic School in 1999. A decade later in 2009, Hai Sing celebrated its golden jubilee.

In 2012, Hai Sing gained niche status in robotics and won first place in the World Vex Championship held in the United States. It has since been winning numerous local and international championships in robotics. In 2013, Hai Sing attained its second niche in student leadership. In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and it launched the Learning for Life Programme in Student Leadership to develop students’ potential. 

In 2019, Hai Sing celebrated its 60th anniversary.

#### **School Motto**
Ad Veritatem Per Caritatem<br>
To Truth through Charity

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/haisingcatholic1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest consists of a shining star with a boat underneath it, which represents the school as the ‘star of the sea’. It features the Chinese name of the school, 海星天主教中学, at the top and ‘Hai Sing Catholic School’ at the bottom. Hai Sing, or ‘Star of the Sea’, is the name given to Mary, Mother of God. Like Mary, who guides all through life’s trials and tribulations, the star guides and protects the ship, which represents the school. The star shines brightly and illuminates the correct path to God.
