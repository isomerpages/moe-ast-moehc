#### **School History**
Gongshang Primary School was established as The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Continuation School in January 1920 by Mr Shi Su as a night school at 267 Tanjong Pagar Road. The school moved to 30 Enggor Street on 1 March 1920, and a day school was initiated to provide education for children of migrants at the time.

The school moved to York Hill in June 1929. It was closed during the Japanese Occupation and reopened after the war. Due to the ageing population in the estate, the school was renamed Gongshang Primary School in 1984 and moved to Tampines New Town in 1986. In 1987, Gongshang Primary School relocated to its current premises at Tampines Street 42. It was officially opened in 1989. The school became single session in 2015. It set up its Alumni Youth Wing in 2016, which coincided with its first homecoming in the school’s history.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, Character Through Sports, provides students with authentic learning experiences to hone their social emotional competencies to demonstrate the core values of responsibility, integrity, care, resilience, teamwork and harmony.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Gongshang, Gongshang here’s where we belong,<br>
Our skills and knowledge ever will grow strong.<br>
Teachers, dear, to guide us on our way,<br>
We’ll try hard in work and play.

Chorus:<br>
Then we know we can stand tall,<br>
So certain we’ve given our all.<br>
Loyal e’er to Gongshang,<br>
Long after our song’s been sung.

Thrifty, honest we will always be,<br>
Helpful to others acting courteously.<br>
Showing care for friends and family,<br>
All growing in harmony.

Chorus:<br>
Then we know we can stand tall,<br>
So certain we’ve given our all.<br>
Loyal e’er to Gongshang,<br>
Long after our song’s been sung.
