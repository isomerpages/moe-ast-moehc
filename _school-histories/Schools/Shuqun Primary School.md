#### **School History**
Shuqun Primary School has a long history. It was originally established in 1925 as the Chinese-medium Tuan Cheng Public School, which was housed in a wooden hut with an attap roof at the junction of Jalan Seh Chuan and Lorong Kulit. However, the school ceased to function after a short period. It was revived in 1933 as Seh Chuan School. The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation and reopened in 1946.

In 1958, it was renamed Seh Chuan High School, and later became a full school with primary and secondary classes to meet the increasing demand for schooling in the community. Additional classrooms and facilities were provided through several extension projects. A six-storey building – with a hall, a central library, laboratories and special rooms – was completed in September 1976.

The enrolment continued to rise, but there was no room for further expansion. The Ministry of Education then offered to take over the school as a government school. In April 1984, Seh Chuan High School ceased to be a full school, and split into Shuqun Primary and Shuqun Secondary. In March 1985, both schools moved to new premises in Jurong East.&nbsp;

In January 1986, Shuqun Primary School relocated to Jurong West Street 51. On 30 June 1986, a new school song was sung, and the school flag bearing the new school crest was raised for the first time. It marked the beginning of many opportunities and milestones to come.

The school’s PRIME upgrading project was completed in 2002. Shuqun Primary School’s vision and mission were refined, and the school strengthened its focus on holistic education and subsequently established its Learning for Life Programme in Outdoor Education in 2014&nbsp;as well as Applied Learning Programme in Environmental Education, in 2019.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KYzntHPLC8WaLf9Y_Hh7oqspX6Xzk1sD/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a>

Let us strive for perfection, let us do our best,<br>
As we honour our nation and honour our crest.<br>
Let us march forward boldly into the years to come and<br>
may we forever be seen as one.

Chorus<br>
Shuqun, Shuqun by you we have been taught<br>
to strive for excellence in studies, arts and sports.<br>
Lifting our banner high, stand straight and tall and<br>
be quick to respond when duty calls.

Let us strive for quality in all we do,<br>
At home or at play or in our school.<br>
Let’s unite our strength together for onward we must go,<br>
an example to others we must show.
