#### **School History**
In 2013, Spectra Secondary School was established as one of two Specialised Schools catering to Normal Technical N(T) students and welcomed its first cohort in 2014.

Offering a four-year customised programme, Spectra prepares students for subsequent studies in ITE or employment. In addition to the N(T) subjects, industry-focused modules in a range of areas, developed in conjunction with ITE and the industry, are offered. These are ITE Skills Certificate (ISC) courses in four areas, namely Hospitality Services, Retail Services, Facility Services and Mechanical Servicing. Students will graduate with two certifications, the GCE N(T) Level Certificate and the ITE Skills Certificate (ISC).

To keep abreast with future industry development, a curriculum review was conducted in 2018. The ISC will be replaced by the ITE Skills Subjects Certification (ISSC) in 2021. The ISSC consists of the following: Culinary & Restaurant Operations, Retail & E-Commerce, Internet of Things (IoT) Applications, Mechanical Design & Automation and Mobile Web Applications. The first cohort of students to take the new ISSC courses will be in 2021. 

The School’s curriculum focuses on three broad areas. The first is on social and personal learning, aimed at nurturing students’ self-worth, self-confidence, motivation and their career aspirations. The second emphasises on building students’ literacy and numeracy skills to lay the foundation for them to succeed at school, at work and in their daily life. The third focuses on building skills, knowledge and attitude for work and life via a curriculum that combines academic subjects with application-oriented and vocational programmes.

The School was officially opened on 4th Oct 2016 and is located at 1, Woodlands Drive 64.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Krishnan Aravinthan (2013-2019)<br>
\- Mr Tan Teck Hock (2020-present)

#### **School Motto**

<br clear="left">

Together We Can

The motto “Together We Can” is the School’s rallying call. It serves to remind every Spectran that with collective effort and steadfast faith, we can achieve success.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/spectrasec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Spectra in Latin means Spectrum and it encapsulates our philosophy of recognising the different strengths and talents of our students.

The School logo features a star that radiates a band of colours emanating from a single light source. The emerging colours symbolise the multiple streams of opportunities offered by the School. The radiating lines reflect the School’s recognition that each student’s learning progress will be different.

_Dusk Purple_ represents the School’s commitment to nurture our students to grow and shine. _Pink_ represents compassion, love and kindness, while _Green_ represents a vibrant and positive attitude towards life.

The angled lines converging towards the centre depict a strong community spirit resembling the _kampung_ or “village”, and a reminder that _“It takes a village to raise a child”._

In essence, it represents the School’s commitment to provide multiple platforms to help every student shine to the brightest of their potential.

**\[_Verse_\]**<br>
It's not too late to make the best of this<br>
Right now is the time to spread our wings<br>
And fly away to a greater height<br>
We live a life of resilience by our side<br>
All the time

**\[_Pre_ _Chorus_\]**<br>
And when it’s tough, we will hold on<br>
We stand together and carry on<br>
If we ever fall, we will rise again

**\[_Chorus_\]**<br>
Together we can, we will make it through<br>
We'll do our best to make our dreams come true<br>
We'll stand by each other, cause there's so much<br>
We can do

**\[_Chorus_\]**<br>
Together we can<br>
Together we can

**\[_Pre_ _Chorus_\]**<br>
And when it’s tough, we will hold on<br>
We stand together and carry on<br>
If we ever fall, we will rise again

**\[_Chorus_\]**<br>
Together we can, we will make it through<br>
We'll do our best to make our dreams come true<br>
We'll stand by each other, cause there's so much<br>
We can do

**\[_Chorus 2_\]**<br>
We’ll always be here, to give a helping hand<br>
To all our friends we will never forget<br>
We stand by each other as we go through every day

**\[_Outro_\]**<br>
Together we can<br>
Together we can<br>
Together we can<br>
Together we can<br>
Together we can
