#### **School History**
Established in 1987, Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School was situated along Ah Hood Road. Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School was formed as a result of an amalgamation of Lee Kuo Chuan School and Thomson Primary School. This newly formed school also took in students from Rayman Primary School, which closed in 1984. The school was officially declared open on 3rd April 1987 by Mr Lawrence Sia Khoon Seong, former Member of Parliament for Moulmein Constituency. &nbsp;

When Balestier Hill Primary School closed in 1988, the remaining students joined Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School in 1989.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 1997, Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School closed. &nbsp;Its site has been used by Lee Ah Mooi Old Age Home. &nbsp;

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Phillips Hsiu (1987 â€“ unknown)
