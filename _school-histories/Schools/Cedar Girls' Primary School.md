#### **School History**
Established in 1957, Cedar Girls’ Primary School was located at Cedar Avenue, beside Cedar Boys Primary School.  
  
The school focused not only on academic development but also on the holistic growth of its students. Morning assemblies at Cedar Girls’ Primary were not complete without a mass exercise led by a gymnastics teacher. In addition, the school’s gymnastics team won many gold medals in inter-school competitions. Likewise, the school band was also ranked among the top three primary school bands in Singapore then.  
  
Cedar Girls’ Primary School and Cedar Boys’ Primary School held their annual sports meet at Cedar Girls’ Secondary School’s compound. Both primary schools eventually merged in 1985 to form Cedar Primary School.
