#### **School History**
Established in 1963, Telok Ayer Primary School, formerly known as Telok Ayer Integrated Primary School,&nbsp; was located at Telok Ayer Street. The school was housed in the former site of Anglo-Chinese Free School.&nbsp;  
  
Over time, the enrolment rates declined and Telok Ayer Primary School closed in 1984. In 1985, the remaining students of Telok Ayer Primary School joined Yeung Ching School (currently Yangzheng Primary School). From 1984 to 2013, Telok Ayer Performing Arts Centre was housed in the former site of the school. After 2013, the school building was demolished and since then, Frasers Tower Business Centre has occupied the former site of the school.
