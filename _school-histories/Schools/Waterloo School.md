#### **School History**
Established in the early 1950s, Waterloo School was located along Waterloo Street, next to Stamford Girls’ School. Both schools shared a common school field.

In 1984, Waterloo School merged with Stamford Girls’ School to form Stamford Primary School. The merged school was named Stamford Primary School, taking its name from Stamford Girls’ School, while it retained Waterloo School’s crest. In 1986, Stamford Primary School moved to a new site in Victoria Lane. Since then, the former Waterloo School building at Waterloo Street has housed the Stamford Arts Centre.
