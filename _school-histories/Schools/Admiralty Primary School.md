#### **School History**
Established in 1997, Admiralty Primary School started with 45 classes at Woodlands Circle. Built in the midst of a flourishing public-housing neighbourhood, the school serves the growing population of children in the estate. Being a relatively young school, Admiralty Primary was free to experiment, create and innovate. In a few short years, the school managed to forge a unique identity for itself.   
  
The school was officially opened on 26 June 1999. Since then, Admiralty Primary School has gone from strength to strength to provide its students with an all-round education centred on developing their potential to the fullest and enabling them to succeed in an evolving landscape.   
  
In recognition of the school’s excellent national education efforts, the school was awarded the Lee Kuan Yew National Education Award in 2010. Building on its strong foundation in National Education, Admiralty Primary School implemented the Learning for Life Programme (LLP1), ‘Appreciating and Building Cross-Cultural Skills through the Arts’ in 2014. Anchoring on the importance of globalization, the school’s LLP1 was designed to enable its students to be globally aware and learn cross-cultural skills such as having the right attitude towards cultural differences, acquiring understanding of different cultural practices and worldviews, as well as developing the ability to understand, communicate and effectively interact with people across cultures within and outside of Singapore.   
  
In 2015, the school embarked on its Learning for Life Programme (LLP2), ‘High Performance Mindset for Personal Leadership’. LLP2 seeks to inculcate in its students a set of performance character values such as perseverance and confidence to enable its students to take on challenges, work hard, and act on their learning gaps for improvement. The school has a four-year performance character programme that explicitly teaches students ways to develop their performance characters, coupled with authentic learning experiences for the students to put all that they have acquired into practice. 

The school is certainly not one that rests on its laurel. In 2019, the school wove its LLP1 into its CCE school-based curriculum. It has since replaced its LLP1 with Applied Learning Programme, ‘Design Thinking for Sustainability’. The ALP seeks to develop in its students a sense of care and concern for environmental issues as well as arm its students with a set of values upon which they could make sound decisions and take appropriate actions to promote environmental sustainability.

Admiralty Primary School celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2017. It remains committed to providing the best learning environment for its students, so that they will grow up to be good citizens and passionate learners.

#### **School Motto**
Knowledge with Humanity

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/admps.png" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
The school crest was designed through collaborative effort of the teachers. The symbols of an open book, a hand and five bands in a circular badge with the colors, blue, yellow and red form the emblem. The colors, blue, yellow and red stand for humanity, excellence and equal opportunity respectively.

<br clear="left">

The open book represents the knowledge acquired by a student through the two stages of Primary Education (Foundation and Orientation). The hand symbolizes guidance and humanity. The five bands signify the five shared values that form the foundation of our nation.

1\. Nation before community and society above self<br>
2\. Family as the basic unit of society<br>
3\. Community support and respect for the individual<br>
4\. Consensus, not conflict<br>
5\. Racial and religious harmony

The letter ‘A’ formed by these symbols is derived from the school’s name. The circle, which encloses these symbols, signifies the rounded education that the school provides.

#### **School Song**

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

With an all round education<br>
We shall keep on moving<br>
Striving for excellence in everything we do<br>
Using knowledge as our strength with humanity<br>
To care and share, a helping hand<br>
For those who are in need
  
We are proud of Admiralty Primary<br>
Where the best in education can be found<br>
We're the best, and always looking far beyond<br>
We'll stand proud and tall<br>
We'll stand proud and tall for our dear school
  
Here we learn to be achievers<br>
For society<br>
We're prepared to do our best for school and country<br>
There'll be problems we may face, but we'll persevere<br>
To plan our life the best we can<br>
For a brighter future
