North Spring Primary, we are proud to call our own.<br>
We must strive to be noble and steadfast, we will work heart and mind as one.<br>
To excel in studies and aesthetics.<br>
Together we shall persevere.<br>
Marching forward, in one spirit and goal.<br>
We are one, we are family.<br>
We will stand tall with heads held high.<br>
Noble and steadfast, surely we will be.

North Spring Primary, a great place for work and play.<br>
We must strive to be learned and cultured, we will march forward as one.<br>
To live in racial harmony.<br>
To show the world we care and share.<br>
Marching forward, in one spirit and goal.<br>
We are one, we are family.<br>
We will stand tall with heads held high.<br>
Noble and steadfast, surely we will be.
