#### **School History**
Parry Primary School was established in 1981 along Parry Avenue from the merger of three schools: Parry Avenue Boys’ School, Parry Avenue Girls’ School and Parry Avenue Government Chinese Middle School.

In the same year, Parry Primary School was one of the first two primary schools in Singapore to conduct full-day sessions, with lessons conducted between 7.30 a.m. to 3 p.m. for upper primary classes, and 7.30 a.m. to 2.30 p.m. for lower primary classes. This pilot programme ceased in 1984, and Parry Primary returned to being a double-session school.

The school published a regular newsletter,&nbsp;_The Parryscope_.

In 2007, Parry Primary School merged with Xinghua Primary School.
