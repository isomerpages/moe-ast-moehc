#### **School History**
Established in 2011, Edgefield Secondary School (EFSS) is a government school located in Punggol. It was officially opened on 12 July 2013. Guided by the vision, ‘Collaborative Innovators, Compassionate Leaders’, and the mission, ‘Growing Minds. Glowing Hearts’, EFSS believes in providing an all-rounded education that is anchored on values and preparing its students to be future-ready.

The Edgefield curriculum nurtures innovators who collaborate actively with others to design and develop creative solutions to problems, and who are resilient during setbacks and challenges. They are also compassionate leaders who are inclusive, with the moral courage to do what is right.

In 2014, EFSS was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Innovation & Enterprise. This has quickly evolved into a key and unique aspect of the Edgefield curriculum known as ‘Growing the Edgefield Mindset’ (G.E.M.) G.E.M. is a structured programme that aims to develop students with capabilities that prepare them for the future through carefully designed authentic learning experiences. It develops empathy, enables our students to be alert to opportunities, and be complex problem solvers. They learn and apply divergent and convergent thinking, acquire communication and collaboration skills through group work and innovative thinking. Students in this programme leverage the technology they use in their daily lives in a multi-disciplinary approach to solve real-world problems and benefit the community. Students continue to deepen their interests and passions through various other platforms such as external competitions, CCAs and school events.

EFSS’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Character Education through Sports’, also accorded in 2014, is focused on taekwondo. It is anchored on the school’s belief that sports have the transformative power to develop good character in students, by inculcating positive values such as benevolence, resilience, courage, self-reliance, quick thinking and respect for others. These qualities would enable them to contribute meaningfully to society as well as make learning a lifelong journey.

A third key aspect of the Edgefield curriculum lies in our Technology –Enhanced Learning. Through 1:1 personalised learning through iPads, we integrate cyber wellness and digital literacies across our total curriculum. As a pilot of MOE’s Personalised Digital Learning Programme in 2019, EFSS nurtures and empowers our students to be autonomous learners, ready to embrace new opportunities ahead.

In 2019, EFSS pioneered a new mixed-stream form class system in which the form class comprises students from different streams. Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung highlighted EFSS as a trailblazer for the Full Subject-Based Banding (SBB). Full SBB allows the reshaping of a school’s social environment to benefit the students’ social and emotional growth. These keystone programmes are evident of EFSS’s commitment to realizing our vision, and in providing our students with an edge to succeed in the future.

The school crest is round to represent the school’s commitment in preparing students to be global citizens, while engendering a sense of rootedness to Singapore, the ‘little red dot’. The book signifies the pursuit of wisdom with a sense of wonderment and curiosity to cultivate a love for lifelong learning as well as the school’s ideals of nurturing resolute and compassionate role models anchored in the school values. The diamond in the centre reflects the school’s core belief that every student is a diamond, and it seeks to uncover the innate potential in students to help them acquire deep learning.

We the students of Edgefield<br>
Sincerity, honour, our guide<br>
Growing strong in moral courage<br>
To be role models who are resolute<br>
And compassionate in all we do<br>
A journey of a thousand miles<br>
Begins with a single step<br>
With the goal in sight we will pace our stride<br>
We will strive hard to achieve our aspirations<br>
With grace and virtue, our guiding light
