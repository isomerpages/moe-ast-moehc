#### **School History**
Bedok North Primary School was built in the Bedok North housing estate in January 1980. As the school building was still under construction at that time, lessons were temporarily conducted at Siglap Indah Primary School and Temasek Primary School.

On 1 October 1980, the building was completed and handed over to the school. The school’s official opening was on 19 November 1981.

In 2001, Bedok North Primary School merged with East Coast Primary School. To commemorate the former school, East Coast Primary School built a four-storey rock wall on its premises.

Be our talents one or ten: keep a will to make progress;<br>
Here’s a place for everyone: here’s a place for me.
