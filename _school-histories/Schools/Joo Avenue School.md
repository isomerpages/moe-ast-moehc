#### **School History**
Established in 1964, Joo Avenue School was located at Rangoon Road. The school was officially opened on 13 March 1964 by then Assemblywoman for Moulmein Mrs Devan Nair. Joo Avenue School was initially known as Joo Avenue Integrated Primary School. The school started with students from the all-boys Rangoon Road School and students from the all-girls Chung Kuo Kung Hsieh School. Joo Avenue Integrated Primary School offered both English-medium and Chinese-medium classes.&nbsp;  
  
In 1978, Chinese-medium classes were phased out. Additionally, Malay language was phased out as a second language in 1979. At this point, the school was renamed Joo Avenue School. As residents shifted to new towns such as Ang Mo Kio and Toa Payoh, the number of students enrolled in Joo Avenue School fell. The school closed in 1984 and the school building was demolished. Since then, private estate houses and business buildings have occupied the site.
