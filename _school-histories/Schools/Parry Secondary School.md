<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Located at Parry Avenue, Parry Secondary School was established in 1966.
Parry Secondary School offered Normal and Technical subjects and students
were allowed to choose between both. Furthermore, the school had both Chinese
and English streams.</p>
<p>During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Parry Secondary School’s building
was utilised for basic police training for the Vigilante Corps due to a
lack of training facilities.</p>
<p>With residential shifts to new towns, student enrolment fell. In 1983,
Parry Secondary School was closed. In 1984, Parry Secondary School’s students
merged with Hwi Yoh Secondary School to form Peicai Secondary School. The
former site of Parry Secondary School was occupied by Rosyth School due
to the latter’s space constraints until 2001. Since then, Parry Secondary
School’s building has been left vacant.</p>
