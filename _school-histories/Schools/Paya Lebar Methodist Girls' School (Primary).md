#### **School History**
Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (PLMGS) began on 31 October 1916 as a branch school of Anglo-Chinese School and was known as Paya Lebar English School.  It started functioning as an elementary school in 1917, with a staff of three and a pupil enrolment of 24 boys. In 1918, the school began taking in girls.

In 1935, Mrs Chew Hock Hin became the principal. Mrs Chew is regarded as the founder of the school because she reorganised the school with the help of the American Crusade Fund after the school building was razed to the ground during the Second World War. She enrolled girls into the school, believing that girls have to be educated as well as boys. As a result, the morning school, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School, and the afternoon school, Paya Lebar Methodist Boys’ School, were established.

In 1949, PLMGS became a government-aided school and was still a primary school. Gradually, secondary classes were added until 1954 when it became a full school providing education from Primary One to School Certificate level. In 1961, the school became a full girls’ school.

In 1986, PLMGS relocated to its present site at Lorong Ah Soo. With the relocation, two schools were created – Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ Primary School and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ Secondary School. The school was officially declared open on 22 August 1987. The two schools were later renamed as Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Primary) and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Secondary).

In 2008, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (Primary) has been identified as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Creative Arts (Performing Arts). In 2016, PLMGS celebrated its 100th anniversary, marking the tremendous progress of the school while staying true to its mission of nurturing every PL-Lite into a whole person who lives in favour with God and man.

#### **School Motto**

We **look up** to God for help and guidance as we aim for greater heights of achievement.<br>

#### **School Crest**

The school crest has a cross above the words ‘Paya Lebar MGS’ signifying that Christ is above all. The lines radiating from the cross suggest that the light of God will shine through the school. The background is yellow, which stands for brightness and light, for the school is to be like a beacon to the community.

#### **School Song**

O let our youthful voices ring<br>
With all their joyfulness<br>
In praise and gladness let us sing<br>
Of Paya Lebar MGS (2x)

Here we may seek all wisdom, truth<br>
And ways of kindliness<br>
Through all the years of golden youth<br>
At Paya Lebar MGS (2x)

So when we leave its sheltr'ing walls<br>
We go with fearlessness<br>
Enriched to face life’s greatest call<br>
By Paya Lebar MGS (2x)

Lord bless our school our dear PLMGS<br>
With peace and love and joy and grace<br>
Our PL-Lites we send to lead and bless<br>
From Paya Lebar MGS (2X)

Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey<br>
To serve Him in every way<br>
Glory to God we give and pray<br>
For Paya Lebar MGS (2x)
