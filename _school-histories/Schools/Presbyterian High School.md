#### **School History**
Presbyterian High School was founded as Li Sun High School in 1965, a Chinese mission secondary school. Set up by the Presbyterian Synod, it was located on the premises of Ming Sin Primary School, a subsidiary school on loan from Bethel Presbyterian Church. The name ‘Li Sun’ was derived from the Mandarin translation of Reverend Alan S. Moore Anderson’s name, An Li Sun_._&nbsp;A missionary and champion of education, Anderson dedicated his life to building churches and schools in China and Malaya.&nbsp;

In 1981, the Synod endorsed the new site for the school at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6. It was renamed Presbyterian High School in 1983. The name reflects the school’s Christian mission and is aligned with Singapore’s move to use English as the medium of instruction. Presbyterian High School was officially opened in 1984.

The school was redeveloped under PRIME in 2000. It was transformed into a sprawling campus spanning three hectares of land in Ang Mo Kio and home to over 1,350 students and staff. The new school boasts of infrastructure comprising a hall that can accommodate the entire school population, well-equipped computer laboratories and information technology-enabled classrooms. It also features the National Education Stairwell, an art gallery, an indoor sports hall, a street soccer court and an artificial turf. The new premises were officially opened in 2004.

Over the years, Presbyterian High School has put in place a series of customised programmes to cater to students’ needs and interests. In 2015, the Programme for Holistic Development was initiated to provide age-appropriate as well as ability- and interest-driven activities to nurture learners.&nbsp;In 2016, the school transited from its niche programme to roll out its Lifelong Learning Programme in community and youth leadership and the Applied Learning Programme in forensic and pharmaceutical science. Through these programmes, the school aims to ignite in students the passion for lifelong learning and service to others.&nbsp;From 2020, instead of forensic and pharmaceutical Science being offered under ALP, the new component will be Health Science.

The school holds steadfastly to its intent to instill values and equip students with skills through its infusion of character and citizenship education and 21st-century competencies across its curriculum. Presbyterian High School’s vision is for every graduate to become a ‘Promise Keeper, Hope Builder and Servant Leader’ beyond its gates.

Since its inception in 1965, the school has seen major physical transformations and grown in all domains. Under the leadership of visionary principals and the contributions of dedicated staff, the school has developed to become a school of choice in the northern part of Singapore.

#### **School Motto**
Aflame for Truth

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/presbyterianhighsch1.jpg">

The school crest is topped with two waves signifying the continuous growth and development of the school, from its founding as Li Sun High School to the present Presbyterian High School.

The Burning Bush is the symbol of the Presbyterian Churches around the world and has the motto ‘Nec Tamen Consumebatur’, Latin for ‘Yet It Was Not Consumed’. From these roots, as part of the community of Christians in Presbyterian Churches around the world, the school adopted the motto ‘Aflame for Truth’, in alignment with the school vision, mission and values.

The Cross represents faith in God. The dove with a stalk of olive leaves depicts the development of the spiritual and moral life in the school and guides education, which is represented by the book. The school colours of white and blue feature in the background; white symbolises the quest for truth, while blue symbolises the pursuit of excellence.
