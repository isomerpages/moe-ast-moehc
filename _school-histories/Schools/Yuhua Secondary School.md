#### **School History**
Yuhua Secondary School was established in 1986 as a government co-educational school at 35 Jurong West Street 41, and officially opened on 16 September 1988.

The school’s milestones include being one of the first to introduce computer-based learning and to hold a Cultural Night at the World Trade Centre. Yuhua was known for its hockey team, harmonica group and concert band in the early years. In 2013, the school underwent PRIME upgrading and became one of the first schools to obtain Barrier-free Access certification from the Building and Construction Authority.

In 2019, Yuhua Secondary School and Shuqun Secondary School merged to form the new Yuhua Secondary School, operating from Yuhua’s premises. The merged school has preserved the heritage and adopted the good practices of both schools to develop distinctive programmes. These include the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Coding, Design Thinking and Robotics’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Music-empowered Learners, Our Dynamic Yuhuans’.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/yuhuasec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The bold circular brush stroke depicts the Yuhuan as having a continuous drive to pursue learning and growth.

<br clear="left">

The alphabet letter ‘Y’ incorporates an open book and a glowing flame. The torch symbolizes the school’s vision of education, in lighting up the student’s desire and quest for learning, and to flourish as a result. The open book, with red and green colours, represents the merger of Shuqun and Yuhua Secondary Schools.

The diagonal strokes on the right represent the latitude and the longitude of the Earth, reflecting the desire for Yuhuans to adopt a global outlook and perspective.
