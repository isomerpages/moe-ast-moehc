#### **School Motto**
Dare to Aspire, Courage to Excel

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/fernvalepri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The stylised letters ‘F’ and ‘V’ that form the integral part of the school’s logo when put together represents the cross section of a fearless head of a lion.  
  
Courageous, bold and strong being the trademarks of a lion, it also symbolises the spirit of Fernvale Primary – “Daring and Courageous”.  
  
Encircling the stylised letters is a solid ring that signifies an all-round, holistic education that Fernvale Primary offers to every student. Enhancing that holistic feel is the use of the colour green to communicate a “nurturing” feel.
