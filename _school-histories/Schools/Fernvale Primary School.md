Fernvale Primary School was established on 3 January 2005 in Sengkang West. The enrolment then was around 230 students with 18 teachers and eight non-teaching staff members. The school was officially opened in July 2007.

The school progressed steadily through the early years, anchored on sound values and a strong culture of care among students and teachers. Fernvale Primary School also established a Satellite Partnership with Fernvale Gardens School to provide opportunities for meaningful interactions between the students of both schools. The school has continually develop Fernvale Primary students into global learners of tomorrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;

In 2014, Fernvale Primary School also introduced its Learning for Life Programme, Greenova, which aims to nurture innovative, responsible, young environmentalists who love and care for the environment.

In 2017, the school was awarded PESTA Statellite School status by the MOE Physical Education and Sports Teachers Academy (PESTA). It was to recognise and affirm the quality of the physical education lessons conducted by the team of PE teachers and the school-wide health promotion programmes.

In 2018, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme – Future Skills Programme. The programme seeks to nurture confident learners who persuade and convince others on innovative digital ideas and solutions and to develop lifelong learners who are able to identify problems, analyse emerging trends, adapt and discover innovative solutions to real life issues. Beyond this, the school wants its students to be involved citizens who add value to the community through innovative digital solutions.

#### **School Motto**
Dare to Aspire, Courage to Excel

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/fernvalepri1.jpg">

The stylised letters ‘F’ and ‘V’ that form the integral part of the school’s logo when put together represents the cross section of a fearless head of a lion.

<br clear="left">
  
Courageous, bold and strong being the trademarks of a lion, it also symbolises the spirit of Fernvale Primary – “Daring and Courageous”.  
  
Encircling the stylised letters is a solid ring that signifies an all-round, holistic education that Fernvale Primary offers to every student. Enhancing that holistic feel is the use of the colour green to communicate a “nurturing” feel.
