#### **School History**
Established in 1955, Siglap Secondary School was originally operating from a two-storey building with 20 classrooms at Cheviot Hill in Siglap. The school was Singapore’s first co-educational secondary school. In 1980, Siglap Secondary also served as a pre-university centre. In 1994, the last batch of pre-university students graduated from the school, and it returned to being a full secondary school.

In 1998, Siglap Secondary relocated to new premises in Pasir Ris. The newer campus included upgraded facilities, and the school became single-session in the same year.

Siglap Secondary sought to establish itself as a choice school for the arts. The school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in visual communication to equip students with the prerequisite skills to pursue a higher education in visual communication at the post-secondary level. It also aimed to develop in students an understanding of how visual images, texts and contexts could be used creatively to communicate powerful messages to their intended audience.

The Learning for Life Programme was also delivered through the performing arts and offered both broad-based opportunities for arts engagement for all students as well as specialised skills development relating to the arts. The programme aimed to develop the students’ character and create active citizens through arts advocacy.

In January 2017, Siglap Secondary School merged with Coral Secondary School to form Meridian Secondary School.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/siglapsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The open book symbolises the quest for knowledge. The colours green and blue, also reflected in the school uniform, represent the sky and the sea, which were part of the Siglap horizon when it was founded. The meeting of the land and the sea signifies the broadening of the mental horizon, which students should strive for. The lion on the castle is part of the state emblem, representing courage.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We typify progressive Singapore<br>
Imbued with courage, love and loyalty.<br>
To serve our state be ever proud and brave<br>
So that our Nation will prosper and be great.

Students of Siglap<br>
Rally to this call,<br>
Prepare to broaden mental horizons,<br>
Eager to learn our duties we fulfil<br>
We’ll reap the harvest when the time is due

Together all we’ll strive united<br>
Despite our rank, race, colour or belief<br>
To one another ever good and true<br>
Till peace and happiness will we achieve.
