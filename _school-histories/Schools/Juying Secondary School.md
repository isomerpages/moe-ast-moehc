#### **School History**
Established in 1995, Juying Secondary School began operations at Pioneer Secondary School for six months while the former Jurong Institute was being retrofitted to become Juying’s permanent home. The school moved into the premises at 33 Jurong West Street 91 on 12 June 1995 and was officially opened on 18 July 1997.

In June 1999, a building extension project saw the addition of a new classroom block and an information technology (IT) block housing two computer laboratories and three IT resource rooms. The expansion made it possible for the school to become single-session.

A decade later, Juying underwent PRIME upgrading from 2009 to 2012. Its upgraded facilities included a spectacular dance studio with floor-to-ceiling glass windows overlooking the parade square, an indoor sports hall and a synthetic soccer field.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme is in languages and humanities, entitled ‘Developing Confident and Competent Communicators through Oracy Skills Programmes’. Its Learning for Life Programme is in music and the performing arts, entitled ‘iACE@Juying’ (I Appreciate, I Create, I Exhibit at Juying). The latter seeks to plant the seed of aesthetics appreciation in the students, develop their artistic abilities and provide them with opportunities to create and exhibit their artistic talents. In 2013 and 2015, the school received the National Arts Education GLOW Award in recognition of its well-established aesthetics development programme.

The school celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2015 with the theme, ‘Living the Legacy, Nurturing for Tomorrow’.

#### **School Motto**
Together We Will Succeed

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/juyingsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The key stands for the letter ‘J’ and symbolises the key for success. The book’s spine and its edges represent the letter ‘Y’, symbolising knowledge. The gears stand for the letter ‘S’ and symbolise technology and harmony. Together they form ‘JYS’, the initials of the school name. The school colours of yellow and blue symbolise respectively brightness, hope and success; and confidence, loyalty and stability. Together, the school crest signifies that the key to bring about success to the school and the nation is through knowledge, technology and working harmony.
