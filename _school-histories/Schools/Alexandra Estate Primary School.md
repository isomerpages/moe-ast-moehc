#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Alexandra Estate Primary School was located at Tanglin Road. The school uniform was a red pinafore dress with a white inner blouse for girls and a white collared top with red shorts for boys.  
  
In 1988, the school merged with Jervois Primary, which was subsequently closed in 1989. Since 1994, Crescent Girls’ School occupies the former site of Alexandra Estate Primary School.
