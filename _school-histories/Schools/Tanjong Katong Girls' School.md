#### **School History**
Tanjong Katong Girls' School was established in 1953 as the first post-war government English-medium girls' school in colonial Singapore.

In 1983, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School was selected to start the Music Elective Programme. In 1995, the school gained autonomous status and moved to 20 Dunman Lane. The official opening of the school’s new campus was held on 11 July 1997. In 2003, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary.

In 2001, the school developed CCA niches in the Symphonic Band, String Ensemble and Choir. The school further pursued excellence in holistic development through the introduction of the Integrated Character Development Programme known as Leading, Empowering, Guiding, Affirming and Challenging Youth (LEGACY). Soon after, in 2005, the school developed new CCAs in Tennis, Badminton, Sailing and Netball. In 2006, the school was identified as a Centre of Excellence for English Language.

In 2013, the school celebrated its 60th Anniversary. The school encouraged the spirit of paying it forward through the TKGS+ Programme which emphasized stewardship of knowledge and skills with students applying their deep understanding in subject disciplines to benefit communities and the environment. In 2016, the school underwent PRIME and relocated to its holding site at 2, Bedok South Road. In 2018, the school celebrated its 65th Anniversary. 2019 marked a new beginning as the school returned to the newly upgraded campus at 20 Dunman Lane.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We cannot all be heroes and thrill a hemisphere<br>
With some great daring venture, some deed that mocks at fear<br>
But we can fill a lifetime with kindly acts and true<br>
There's always noble service for noble souls to do<br>
We're not all blessed with beauty nor everyone with brain<br>
But each from every other has something good to gain<br>
So let us make an effort to keep it as a rule<br>
That each one needs the other within the Katong School<br>
Then let us fill the hours with minutes truly spent<br>
In helping one another towards a true content<br>
So let us serve with honour and work for selfless fame<br>
For credit of our country and glory of her name
