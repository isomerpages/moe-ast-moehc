At Tampines North Primary School<br>
Our aim is to be Noble and True<br>
Our goal is to strive<br>
to reach for the star<br>
To shine forth both near and far<br>
Each of us will heed the call<br>
To be a light for one and all<br>
Steadfast and worthy we’ll want to be<br>
A gleaming example for all to see<br>
For our country we’ll do our best<br>
With shields up right we’ll stand the test<br>
With our mind and body, spirit and soul<br>
We’ll go all out to reach our goals<br>
