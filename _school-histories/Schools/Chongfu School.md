#### **School History**
Chongfu Primary School was founded by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan in 1915 as Chong Hock Girls’ School. Situated at Chong Wen Ker beside the Thian Hock Keng Temple on Telok Ayer Street, it was the only school for girls then. The medium of instruction was Hokkien.  
  
In 1930, the school extended its premises to Stanley Street. In the same year, Mandarin became the medium of instruction.  
  
In 1942, the school closed due to Japanese Occupation. In 1945, the school reopened. Four years later, it had its first intake of boys with sisters studying in the school. In 1955, it moved to the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan Building at 137 Telok Ayer Street. A branch was subsequently set up at Amoy Street. In 1957, the school became a government-aided school.  
  
In 1981, the school name was changed to Chong Hock School. The school relocated to its present premises in Yishun New Town in 1985, and was renamed Chongfu Primary School in the following year. In 2010, Chongfu Primary School was renamed Chongfu School. The school held its centennial celebration in 2015, remembering its rich heritage and legacy.
