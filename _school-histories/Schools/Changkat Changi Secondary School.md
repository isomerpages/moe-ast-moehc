#### **School History**
Changkat Changi Secondary School began as an integrated school on a small hill at Jalan Tiga Ratus in 1966. It was named after its geographical location – ‘Changkat’ is the Malay term for ‘small hill’, and ‘Changi’ refers to the mythological Changi Tree. When the school first opened, besides students who lived on the mainland, the school also served students from the kampongs on the islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong. These students used to go to school by ferry every morning, and returned home on the evening ferry.

Lessons were conducted in three mediums of instruction: English, Mandarin and Behasa Melayu. As Singapore took on English as its lingua franca, the Malay and Chinese streams were slowly phased out, and English became the medium of instruction by 1973.

To support nation-building in the early years of Singapore’s independence, the initial curriculum emphasised technical studies. In tandem with the evolving educational landscape over the last 50 years, today the school offers its students a broad-based and holistic education in a nurturing and dynamic environment. In 2001, the school moved to its present premises at 23 Simei Street 3.

Changkat Changi Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in aerospace and aviation, and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in community youth leadership. The school’s LLP, ‘Service and Leadership, Through School to Nation’, aims to help students develop their leadership skills through engaging the community, as students at various levels are exposed to a range of leadership opportunities. The school’s ALP, ‘SOAR (Student-centered Opportunities for Aerospace industry)’, enables students to develop knowledge and skills through applied learning in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
