#### **School Song**
 <small>*School song unavailable*</small>
 
Let us all the youth of our school,<br>
Pledge ourselves this solemn promise<br>
We will strive for truth and honour,<br>
Build a better world for all<br>
Let us all the youth of our school<br>
Press onwards to the future,<br>
Against all odds,<br>
Never failing,<br>
We grow from strength to strength,<br>
We think we do,<br>
We work together to honour our alma mater,<br>
With one heart and mend the spirit new,<br>
One for all and all for one.
