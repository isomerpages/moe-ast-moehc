#### **School Motto**
Ready to Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/rosythsch1.jpg">

The original version of the crest was an etched metal. The elements comprise a candle, stripes, white and blue colours and the school motto, ‘Ready to Serve’. Chinese scholars and clergymen of medieval times depended on the candlelight for the long hours of learned reading and writing, as electricity had not been invented then.

Knowledge has long been documented in the form of pictograms, symbols and the written word. While the mode of reading may differ from one ethnic culture to another, the horizontal line formation has been the general accepted norm. The stripes represent the written page. The shield format is associated with one arming himself/herself with knowledge.

The motto aims to inculcate in the students a sense of civic consciousness and be ‘Ready to Serve’ the country, community and family to whom they belong.
