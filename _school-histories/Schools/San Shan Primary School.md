#### **School History**
San Shan Primary School’s history began in 1926. It originated as a small Chinese-medium school at Craig Road near Tanjong Pagar that was set up by a group of Foochow businessmen. It was known as San Shan school (三山学校) then. The school closed three years later but in 1946, the school reopened in two locations – 20 Craig Road and 64 Queen Street – and had a total of 80 students. In early 1947, the school moved to new premises at 107A Sophia Road. In 1957, San Shan School became a fully government-aided school.

In 1982, San Shan School relocated to new premises in Toa Payoh North Road as San Shan Primary School and became a full government school. It also became an English-medium school and offered Malay and Chinese as second languages. The school was officially declared open on 26 October 1984.

In 2002, San Shan Primary School merged with Braddell Primary School and Westlake Primary School to become First Toa Payoh Primary School.
