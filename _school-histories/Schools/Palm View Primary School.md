#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/palmviewpri1.png">

The emblem expresses the aspirations that school leaders of Palm View Primary School bear for the school, and consists of a central torch, an open book and a victory laurel crowned with a burning flame.

The torch is a bearer of light and symbolises the school’s belief in the potential of every individual. Each student is unique and special, with the capacity to learn, advance and succeed, all the time being a force for good in this world. This belief forms the foundation for all educational endeavours and supports the school’s commitment to develop in every child 21st-century literacies and competencies, symbolised by the open book. The laurel, often used as a symbol of Olympic victory, expresses the school’s pursuit of educational excellence and its commitment to holistic education. This is crowned by a burning flame signifying light and truth, and expresses the school’s desire to inspire both teachers and students in the hope that they, too, will inspire others. The school’s vision, ‘Inspiring Excellence’, is placed across the central torch.

Orange and green colours are chosen for the emblem to signify youthfulness, courage and vitality – qualities that the school hopes its students will exude.
