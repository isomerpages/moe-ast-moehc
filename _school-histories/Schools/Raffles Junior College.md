#### **School History**
Raffles Junior College (RJC) was established in 1982, when the pre-university section of Raffles Institution was transferred from Grange Road to a temporary campus at Paterson Road. The junior college was the first to be established with both JC1 and JC2 students, with the JC2 students having just completed their first pre-university year in the pre-university section of RI.  In 1984, Raffles Junior College moved to its new campus on 53 Mount Sinai Road.

RJC offered a forward-looking, differentiated and learner-centred curriculum. The college provided students with added depth and exposure in their chosen disciplines through various special enrichment programmes, such as the Raffles Asia Programme and Science@Raffles.

In 2004, an integrated programme between Raffles Junior College, Raffles Institution (RI) and Raffles Girls’ School, called the Raffles Programme (RP), was implemented. This was a six-year broad-based programme that enabled students to proceed seamlessly from secondary one to the GCE “A” Levels. RJC received the first cohort of RP students in January 2006.

In December 2004, RJC moved to its new Bishan campus at 1 Raffles Institution Lane.

On 1 January 2005, RJC became an independent institution. In the same year, it also became the first junior college to be awarded the School Excellence Award, the highest award in the MOE Masterplan of Awards. On 8 April 2006, the new campus was officially opened by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.

On 1 January 2009, Raffles Junior College reintegrated with Raffles Institution to facilitate the running of the Integrated Programme. In 2010, the college section (Years 5 to 6) was officially renamed Raffles Institution.

#### **School Motto**
Auspicium Melioris Aevi<br>
(Hope of a Better Age)

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/rafflesjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The college crest is the coat of arms of the House of Raffles with the Raffles colours of **green**, **black** and **white**. Featuring the gryphon and the eagle prominently, the crest graphically presents the college’s values and goals.

The **gryphon**, a mythological creature known for its strength and speed, is depicted in the crest as being set in a crown in all its majesty. The gryphon represents the strength of the college in facing challenges courageously and the speed with which the college is able to adapt deftly to the many changes in the social, economic and educational landscape.

The eagle, a mighty and majestic creature that rules the skies, is portrayed in the crest as double-headed, with each head looking in opposite directions. One head looks back on the glories of the past while the other looks ahead to possibilities brimming in the future. The **double-headed eagle** represents the college’s tradition of constantly drawing strength from our past achievements  and, at the same time, forging ahead with an eye on a brighter future.

The **motto**, Auspicium Melioris Aevi, set in a belt below the crest, is Latin for “Hope of a Better Age”.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

When Stamford Raffles held the torch<br>
That cast Promethean Flame<br>
We faced the challenge of the day<br>
To give our school a name.<br>
The eagle eye and gryphon strength<br>
They led us to the fore<br>
To reign supreme in ev’ry sphere<br>
The Sons Of Singapore<br>
Come heed the call Rafflesians all<br>
And let our hearts be stirring<br>
We’ll do our best whate’er the test<br>
And keep our colours flying<br>
Let comradeship and fervent hope<br>
With one voice make us pray<br>
Auspicium Melioris Aevi<br>
With God to guide the way.
