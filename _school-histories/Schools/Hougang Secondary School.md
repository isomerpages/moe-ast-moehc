#### **School History**
Hougang Secondary School (HS) was established in 2001 as a government co-educational school, located on Lowland Road. On 20 December 2001, the school moved to its current site at Hougang Street 93. The new environment offered opportunities for all Hougeans to strive for excellence and make a difference.

To provide a holistic and quality education for students to pursue their strengths and passion, the school partners parents and stakeholders to care, lead and inspire students to discover their passion and fulfil their aspirations. HS places strong emphasis on character and values education. It is committed to nurture every Hougean into passionate learners, principled leaders and grateful citizens. Students are imbued with the school’s core values of GRIT (gratitude, respect, ingenuity, trustworthiness and grit) through its Instructional, Character and Citizenship Education, student leadership, co-curricular activities, as well as the Learning for Life and Applied Learning programmes, which cater to the students’ different needs and interests.

HS believes that sound values are the bedrock of character development. Therefore, the school’s Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership, ‘Values in Action, A Hougean Way of Life’, provides a sustained and enhanced values education progressively over four to five years. Using the service learning approach, students take ownership of their involvement in Values-in-Action projects; seek to understand the needs of the community; and co-construct and mentor their peers to bring about awareness, action and advocacy in their chosen need areas.

To nurture Hougeans to be confident and competent speakers, the school’s Applied Learning Programme, ‘Effective Communication Skills through Authentic Learning’, promotes communication skills using real-life learning platforms. By furnishing students with authentic settings and problems, they can acquire useful and transferable communication skills. The programme includes broadcasting, public speaking, debates, drama and journalism.

HS was accorded the School Distinction Award in 2016 and recognised for Best Practices in Student All-round Development, Character and Citizenship Education, and Teaching and Learning.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We sing our song with joy and pride<br>
To tell the world we do things right<br>
Search ourselves to be true<br>
Uphold the creed Hougeans learn in school

We learn the skills with grit and zeal<br>
To stand the tests both tough and real<br>
Urge ourselves to excel<br>
Prepare for the future that none can tell

Chorus:<br>
Respect ourselves, respect others<br>
Thus, we develop noble characters<br>
Work together for Singapore<br>
Make the difference on any shore
