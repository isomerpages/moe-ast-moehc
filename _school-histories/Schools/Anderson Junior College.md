#### **School History**
Anderson Junior College (AJC) was established in 1984. Led by founding principal Mr Lee Fong Seng and 79 academic staff in its first year, the college grew over the years to more than double the staff strength in 2018. Since 1984, there had been periodic infrastructural updates to serve the needs of students, including the additions of a new block, the auditorium and the AJC Hostel.

Serving the community always underpinned the philosophy of education in AJC. Over the years, AJCians had many opportunities to serve communities, both locally and abroad. Started in 1986, the AJC Food and Fun Fair, which later became AJC’s Family Day, served as a platform not just for the AJC family to bond, but also for fundraising activities.

The year 1990 also saw the birth of the AJC Golden Baton Marathon, a fundraising running event. The event evolved to become the Resilience Runs, which typically served charitable causes. AJC’s anniversary celebrations, too, often included an element of community service. For its 20th anniversary, for instance, AJC donated a mobile therapy van to the Asian Women’s Welfare Association. During its 25th anniversary, the whole college took part in a massive community-involvement project in the Ang Mo Kio neighbourhood. As part of its 30th anniversary celebration, AJC’s Tray Return Initiative was launched for food centres in Ang Mo Kio. 

Beyond Singapore, AJC undertook its first overseas community-involvement project in Inner Mongolia in 1998 – a significant milestone in AJC’s history of community service. Since then, such trips to various countries and regions became a regular affair.

In 1994, AJC was designated as the North Zone Centre of Excellence in Science. In this capacity, AJC promoted critical and inventive thinking by building a science research culture among students and teachers. Equipped with high-end science laboratories – Elementz Lab and Nanoscience Lab – students developed their passion in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, while teachers in North Zone schools benefitted from workshops and training conducted in AJC. In addition, AJC had played host to the annual International Elementz Science Research Conference and Exhibition since 2001, an event that attracted the participation of local and overseas schools.

In 2019, AJC merged with Serangoon Junior College to form Anderson Serangoon Junior College. The AJC flag was lowered for the last time in November 2018.

#### **School Motto**
_Non Mihi Solum_<br>
Latin for ‘Not for Myself Alone’

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/andersonjc1.png" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The college crest is formed from the initials of the college. The letter ‘A’, in the form of a yellow flame, symbolises the vitality and youthful aspirations of the students. The dark blue letters, ‘J’ and ‘C’, supporting the flame, symbolise the college’s support for the individual in his/her efforts to realise his/her ambition. The four circles at the base signify racial harmony, highlighting the college motto, ‘_Non Mihi Solum’ (_Latin for ‘Not for Myself Alone’).

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We tread the path of knowledge, bearing yellow flame of light.<br>
With minds keen and spirits burning, ascending to greater heights.
  
Non mihi solum, the sweet light of charity.<br>
Non mihi solum, the richness of humanity.
  
We stand with loving hearts, knowing joy of give and care.<br>
With grateful thought to all who give, returning all and more we’ll share.

Non mihi solum, the sweet light of charity.<br>
Non mihi solum, the richness of humanity.
  
United we stand bold, drinking wisdom ages bestowed.<br>
All worthy tasks we execute with grace, we cherish the best in human race.
  
Non mihi solum, the sweet light of charity.<br>
Non mihi solum, the richness of humanity.
