#### **School History**
Established in 1965, Balestier Hill East Primary School was located along Balestier Road, next to Balestier Hill West Primary School.  
  
Balestier Hill East Primary School merged with Balestier Hill West Primary School in 1986 to form Balestier Hill Primary School. When Balestier Hill Primary School closed in 1988, its pupils joined Lee Kuo Chuan Primary School in 1989. From 1989 to 1991, Methodist Girls’ School (Primary Section) was temporarily housed in Balestier Hill Primary School’s building since the former’s site was undergoing renovations. Since 1991, the site has been used as the MOE Headquarters at Balestier.

**Note**: A new Balestier Hill Primary Hill Primary school later opened at Balestier Hill in 2002. It merged with Bendemeer Primary School in 2019 and relocated to Bendemeer Road.
