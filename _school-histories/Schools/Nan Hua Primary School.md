#### **School History**
Nan Hua Primary School was started by a group of Chinese businessmen in 1917 as the Chinese-medium Nan Hwa Girls’ School on Coleman Street. In 1921, Nan Hwa Girls’ School moved to Bencoolen Street. In 1941, a new school was built on Adis Road, which became the main school, while the school on Bencoolen Street was named Nan Hwa Girls’ High School (Branch). After the Second World War, Nan Hwa Girls’ High School reopened in 1945 and Nan Hwa Girls’ High School (Branch) reopened the following year.

In 1961, the branch school was separated from the main school. The following year, a new building replaced the old one on Bencoolen Street. In 1964, Nan Hwa Girls’ High School (Branch) was renamed Nan Hwa Primary School and became a co-educational school. In the late 1970s, the school’s name was spelt ‘Nan Hua’ instead of ‘Nan Hwa’ when the nation promoted the use of Hanyu Pinyin. In 1978, Nan Hua Primary School offered both English- and Chinese-stream classes. In 1983, Nan Hua Primary School relocated to Clementi Avenue 1 and became an English-medium school. In 1989, Nan Hua Primary School was selected as a Special Assistance Plan school. In 1998, the school relocated to its present premises at Jalan Lempeng and was selected as a Gifted Education Programme Centre. The school offered pre-primary preparatory classes from 1979 to 1991.

In 2002, Nan Hua Primary School completed PRIME upgrading. In 2003, the school became a single-session school. The school celebrated its 90th anniversary in 2007 and its 100th anniversary in 2017. After the celebration of 100 years of Nan Hua’s history, the school premises at Jalan Lempeng underwent PERI upgrading from 2018 to 2019.

In 2015, Nan Hua Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘NHPS Thinking Programme’.  
  
In 2019, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘From ME to WE’.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/nanhuapri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is made up of three eccentric circles, with the circles’ arcs almost meeting one another at the top. The white English initials of the school name are placed in the innermost circle, while the red Chinese characters are placed in the second circle.

The crest has three colours: blue representing decorum, white for integrity and red for love. The innermost circle represents righteousness and sense of shame. The second circle represents loyalty and filial piety. The third circle, which encompasses the first and second circles, symbolises the eight qualities – loyalty, filial piety, humanity, love, courtesy, righteousness, integrity and sense of shame – which the school hopes to inculcate in its students.
