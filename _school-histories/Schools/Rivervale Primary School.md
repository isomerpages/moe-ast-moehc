#### **School History**
Rivervale Primary is a primary school located in the North-eastern part of Singapore. It was established in 1999 at the former premises of Hai Sing High School (Hougang) and Charlton School (Serangoon). 

In March 1999, Rivervale Primary relocated to its present premises at Rivervale Drive and the school was officially opened on 6 July 2001. The school has also gradually expanded its facilities. An indoor sports hall, a rooftop garden and an annex block were added during the PERI upgrading project in 2014. The school strongly believes in the importance of community involvement in our activities. 

In 1999, the school invited students and their families, Rivervale residents, to its first Lantern Festival Celebration to strengthen community bonding. The halal and non-halal mooncake sampling was a big hit with the residents. Exciting student performances were also included as part of the evening’s showcase. The annual NE Trail was another platform for Rivervale Primary to connect with the community.

Invited participants from various primary schools enjoyed activities at various iconic locations to learn more about the various aspects of Singapore and the challenges she faced over the years. From 1999 - 2020, the school sent groups of P2 to P5 students, to neighbouring countries like Malaysia and Thailand for overseas learning journeys as part of the globalisation programme. 

This was then reinvented as the Virtual Global Classroom Activities during the pandemic.

In 2015, Rivervale Primary was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - ‘Dance Fever’ (Dance Aces Nurturing Cultural Expression For EVEry Riverlite). 

In 2021, the school decided to promote dance as a fitness activity, the LLP was hence renamed as ‘Dance and Fitness’. 

In 2018, the school was accorded Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - ‘Multi-literacy Programme’. Life skills for the 21st century was included in the design of this curriculum and embedded in the six modules – civic literacy, financial literacy, environmental literacy, digital literacy, cyberwellness literacy and media literacy.

In 2023, project work element was also infused in the design of the ALP.
