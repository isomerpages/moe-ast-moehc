#### **School History**
Established in 1962, Beatty Primary School, originally known as Beatty Integrated Primary School, was located at Beatty Road.  
  
Over time, enrolment fell and in 1995, Beatty Primary School closed. Its remaining students joined Cambridge Primary School. The former building of the school was retained and has since been occupied by The Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA).
