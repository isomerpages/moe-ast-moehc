<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Pasir Ris Primary School began operations on 4 January 1993 in a holding
school. The school moved to its current premises on 28 June 1993 and was
officially opened on 8 July 1995.</p>
<p>In 2003, the school completed its PRIME upgrading. Since 2006, Pasir Ris
Primary School has been an advocate of Holistic Assessment when it prototyped
Portfolio Assessment in ‘Teach Less Learn More’ Wave 1. The success of
this ground-up initiative led the school to become one of the prototype
schools for Holistic Assessment in 2009. Holistic Assessment practices
in Pasir Ris Primary School have expanded beyond the academic areas to
form part of the repertoire of pedagogical approaches in the physical education,
art and music areas.</p>
<p>In 2009, Pasir Ris Primary School was accorded the East Zone Centre of
Excellence for Character and Citizenship Education. In 2016, the school
underwent PERI upgrading. The new indoors sports hall was officially opened
on 3 August 2018 in conjunction with the school’s 25th anniversary celebration.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Be Our Best</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>The focal point of the school crest is the eight-sided star. The star
symbolises the school’s belief that ‘every child is a winner’. It also
represents the school’s quest to bring out the star quality in every child.
The two contrasting colours within each arm depict a need for balance for
an enriching life. The bold ring encircling the star symbolises an all-round
education.</p>
