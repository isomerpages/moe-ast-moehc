#### **School History**
Braddell-Westlake Secondary School was formed from a merger between Braddell Secondary School and Westlake Secondary School in 2000. Located along Braddell Road, it occupied the former premises of both schools, with the lower-secondary section housed in Campus 1 (Braddell Secondary School) and the upper-secondary section situated at Campus 2 (Westlake Secondary School).

The merged school featured a glass mosaic wall mural, which showcased numerous famous past and present landmarks of Singapore, including the Singapore River, World Trade Centre and the National Theatre. The iconic mural was designed by art teacher Mr Ho Cheok Tin.

BWSS was an active participant in community events in the neighbourhood, such as a mural painting project between 12 March to 3 June 2001, as well as an entrepreneurship project for senior citizens in Ang Mo Kio in the same year.

The school merged with Guangyang Secondary School in 2006.
