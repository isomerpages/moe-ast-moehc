#### **School History**
Peicai Secondary School was established in 1984 following the merger of Parry Secondary School and Hwi Yoh Secondary School. The school name, which means ‘The Nurture of Talents’, is derived from the hanyu pinyin names of the two merged schools. Peicai’s distinctiveness lies in its emphasis on a strong foundation of teacher–student relationship as a bedrock of its ecosystem of care for both students and staff.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme is ‘The Science of Food’, focusing on science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It is integrated into the Science as well as Food and Consumer Education lessons, where students research on macronutrients and incorporate scientific inquiry skills gained during Science lessons.

Peicai’s Learning for Life Programme is in community and youth leadership, titled ‘Becoming Persons for Others – Leadership through and for the Community’. Students embark on a year-long values-in-action project, identifying a cause of action that they are passionate about, planning the action and collaborating with external agencies to serve the community.

Student leadership is a key focus of Peicai, as it believes that every student has leadership potential. Student leaders are nurtured to be inspiring leaders with a daring spirit and a passion to learn, who will make a difference in the school and community.

Aesthetics is also an important domain in Peicai. Every two years, members of performing arts groups put together a concert called _Ignite_, based on a theme that teens can identify with. The themes over the years include ‘Emotions’, ‘Memories’ and ‘Journey’, and these are skillfully woven into the dance, drama, band and guzheng performances to tell a story.
