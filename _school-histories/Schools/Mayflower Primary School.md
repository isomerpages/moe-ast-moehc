#### **School History**
Mayflower Primary School was established in 1979 at 20 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3 as a government co-educational school. The school functioned in two sessions, sharing its premises with Ang Mo Kio Primary School. In 1993, Mayflower Primary took over the premises formerly occupied by Ang Mo Kio Primary. In 2000, it was the first school to complete the PRIME upgrading, and the school moved to its present premises at 200 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5. The new school was officially opened on 17 July 2000.

Over the decades, the school has not only grown in size, but its students were becoming accomplished in their own fields of study. In 2003, Mayflower Primary School celebrated its 24th anniversary by staging a variety show involving many of its talented students and staff. In 2010, the school celebrated its 31st anniversary in conjunction with the inaugural 2010 Summer Youth Olympics Games that was held in Singapore. An original batik painting was co-created by students and staff for the Games, depicting all the different participating nations. 

In 2015, Mayflower Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in the “Development of Character, Citizenship and 21-century Competencies in and through the Arts”. The programme builds on the strengths of the school in providing quality arts education for all students, and in developing their interests and talents in visual arts and drama through its vibrant curricular and co-curricular activities.

In 2018, Mayflower Primary School became the first designated mainstream primary school in Singapore for students with Hearing Loss (HL) who use sign language as the main mode of communication to access the national curriculum. The co-teaching model, which supports an inclusive education where students with HL learn alongside their hearing classmates, is adopted in our school.

The Traits of MFPS students – **_Empowered Learners and Empathetic Leaders_** – was first introduced to the school community in 2018. The Traits of MFPS Students represent the collective hopes and aspirations stakeholders have of all our students. They delineate the distinctive attributes we want our students to be endowed with and support our vision of our students who are “Exemplary Citizens of Tomorrow”. They help us and our students understand what it means to live up to the vision of the school.

In November 2019, STEM@MFPS was approved as an Applied Learning Programme. This is a customised 4-year enrichment programme that focuses on the principles of STEM. In this programme, our students innovate through solving real world problems and creating prototypes. Students are taught basic programming, computational and design thinking skills and learn through exploration by engaging in direct application of these skills, theories and models in an inter-disciplinary environment. Through such opportunities and engagement, we hope to lay a foundation for our students to be equipped with the broad pre-requisites for the future, namely innovation and creativity.

To mark the school’s 40th Anniversary on 16 November 2019, the school was also presented with a certificate from the Singapore Book of Records for the “**_Largest Ship Sculpture with Handpainted Sails_**”. The 7 sails on the lifesize model ship was made of 1040 fabric patches created by staff, students, alumni, parents, SAC members and partners of the school. The patchwork art covered a total area of 30 square metres.

Mayflower Primary School is undergoing PERI upgrading, which will be completed in 2021. The Ministry of Education Kindergarten @ Mayflower is slated to start operations in 2021. With these exciting developments, the school will continue to thrive – nurturing future-ready students who will grow into exemplary citizens of tomorrow, passionate lifelong learners and positive change agents.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Mayflower our very own<br>
Our seeds of learning here are sown<br>
Into good citizens we will grow<br>
We're here to learn and strive,<br>
to give purpose to our life,<br>
for a brighter 'morrow<br>
We are cared for and we care<br>
We receive, so must we share<br>
For the good that's ours not mine<br>
We do our school and nation proud<br>
We make known to all aloud<br>
Tis the spirit of we~ not I
