#### **School History**
Established in 1969, Mount Vernon Secondary School was located at Mount Vernon Road. The school became one of the first local schools to accept pupils with hearing impairment in the mid-1970s.  
  
In 1985, Mount Vernon Secondary School participated in the United Nations Association’s Flags for Peace project.  
  
Mount Vernon Secondary School **closed around 1991**. In the mid-1990s, the vacated Mount Vernon Secondary School was briefly used by Maris Stella High when the latter’s school premises underwent upgrading.  The school compound was later used as a foreign workers’ dormitory before it was demolished.
