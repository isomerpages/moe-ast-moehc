#### **School History**
Seng Kang Secondary School (SKSS) was established on 4 January 1999 as the first secondary school in the Sengkang housing estate. In Chinese, ‘Seng Kang’ means ‘Success and Good Health’.

The school was first located at the former premises of Hai Sing Girls’ High at 1192 Upper Serangoon Road until 12 March 1999, when it moved to its present site at 10 Compassvale Lane. The school was officially opened by Mr Lee Yock Suan, then Minister for Information and the Arts, on 14 July 2001.

In 2002, the school’s Red Cross Unit achieved its first Unit Silver Award. In the following year, the school attained the Ministry of Education Value-Added Academic Award.

The school’s Hockey ‘C’ Division boys’ team made headlines when they emerged as the national champions at the 2005 Hockey National ‘C’ Division Championships, garnering the school’s first national sports title. In the same year, one of the school’s Girl Guides also became the school’s first to attain the President's Guide Award, the highest honour for Girl Guides. This set a precedent for the school’s Girl Guides’ outstanding achievements, which have continued today. 

In 2009, SKSS gained niche status in hockey. Besides achieving success at the school level, some of the players have gone on to represent Singapore at the international games. In 2011, SKSS also became one of the few schools to offer Physical Education as an O-Level subject. 

In 2015, the school launched its Learning for Life Programme, ‘Building Character through Physical Education and Sports’, and its Applied Learning Programme in health science and technology in the following year.

In 2018, SKSS celebrated its 20th anniversary. On 23 March 2018, the school organised a record-breaking event at the Sengkang Sports Complex in commemoration of the school’s 20th-anniversary celebration and the third anniversary of the late Minister Mentor Mr Lee Kuan Yew’s passing. Together, through a strong and united spirit of collaboration and community amongst the school staff and students, the school achieved three Singapore records: the largest display of paper sailboats, largest mass tabata display, and most number of push balls kept in the air. These show the school’s commitment to continue the legacy of the nation’s founding father through hard work and resilience.

The anchor represents the Sengkang district, which was once a harbour. It also signifies the school’s determination to anchor to its beliefs. The rope symbolises teamwork and continuous learning. The anchor and rope combine to form the initials of the school, ‘SKSS’. The school motto, ‘Breakthrough’, reflects the school’s undaunting and tireless spirit in its continuous search for new ideas and improvement.
