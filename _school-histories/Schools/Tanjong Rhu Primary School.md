#### **School History**
Tanjong Rhu Integrated Primary School was established in 1964 at Kampong Arang Road. It was declared open by then Minister for National Development Mr Lim Kim San on 23 October 1964. The school started off as a Chinese-medium school but enrolment declined over time. This prompted the school to transform into an integrated school, offering Chinese and English Language streams.

In 1984, Tanjong Rhu Integrated Primary School merged with Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School and Tanjong Rhu Boys’ School to form Tanjong Rhu Primary School. The amalgamated school was housed on the grounds of both girls’ and boys’ school.&nbsp;**The building of Tanjong Rhu Integrated Primary was subsequently leased out. Tanjong Rhu Primary School was eventually closed in 1989 to make way for Dunman High School, which continues to occupy the site till today.**
