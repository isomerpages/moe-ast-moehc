#### **School History**
Concord Primary School was established in 2000 in Choa Chu Kang. Its unique name, Concord, refers to a state where people or things are in harmony and peace. The name was chosen as the school offers a common home to diverse students, a place where they forge new relationships as well as learn and grow in harmony. Concord Primary was officially opened in 2001. It was also the year that saw its first batch of 173 Concordians excel in PSLE, with 98.8% promoted to secondary schools.

To prepare and equip its students for complex challenges ahead, Concord focuses on enabling Concordians to think, discern and make good decisions in life. The school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in E3 (Enable, Enrich and Empower) Reasoning, so as to develop its students in the acquisition of critical and inventive skills, which are important 21st-century competencies. The school was also accorded a Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Outdoor Education, which is designed to create awareness and promote the benefits of outdoor education. The programme also provides opportunities to students to explore and apply skills learnt and to extend their learning in an authentic environment.

Moving into its 18th year in 2018, Concord continues to provide a conducive environment to develop its students to be confident, upright and resilient individuals with the ability to face future challenges and the commitment to contribute selflessly to the school and society.

Together We Soar To Greater Heights<br>
Music and Lyrics by Loo Teng Kiat<br>
(Verse 1)

Concord Primary is our school, we love her<br>
We work in harmony close together<br>
Respect and we care for all with our hearts<br>
You can count on us<br>
We'll take on the world with love and flair<br>
Responsible words and thoughts we'll share<br>
Resounding in laughter everywhere<br>
(Chorus)

Staying true to this land we call home<br>
Our hearts will beat as one<br>
Staying true to our dreams, our hopes<br>
We'll strive for success; we will show you our best<br>
(Verse 2)

With caring hearts we will love each other<br>
Enrich our minds as we grow together<br>
No matter what colour cos' you are my friend<br>
And I'd call you my brother

Let's reach for the sky<br>
With our determined spirits high<br>
Together we soar to greater heights
