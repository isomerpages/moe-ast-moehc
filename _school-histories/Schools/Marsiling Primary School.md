#### **School History**

#### **School Motto**
_Ilmu Suluh Hidup_&nbsp;(Knowledge Lights Up Our Lives)

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/pic.png">

The school motto&nbsp;_Ilmu Suluh Hidup_&nbsp;(‘Knowledge Lights Up Our Lives’) continues to be of relevance today.&nbsp;The colour white represents virtue and good character, while blue is symbolic of a peaceful and harmonious environment. The four interlocking rings represent our close-knit multicultural school population working together in harmony. The stalk of&nbsp;_padi_&nbsp;is symbolic of hard work and effort required for success. The star reflects the belief that every student can achieve, and the pen represents education&nbsp;that&nbsp;will blaze the way ahead (as shown by the torch) for&nbsp;its&nbsp;students.

The school values are encapsulated in the acronym ‘R3ICE’ (Respect,&nbsp;Responsibility,&nbsp;Resilience,&nbsp;Integrity,&nbsp;Care&nbsp;and&nbsp;Excellence). Infused into both the formal and informal curriculum of the school, R3ICE is the anchor upon which Marsiling Primary’s&nbsp;students build their holistic learning experience – one that prepares them for the complexities and challenges of the future.
