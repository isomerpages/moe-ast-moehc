#### **School History**
East View Primary School (EVPS) was established in 1987 at the premises of Qiaonan Primary School. It relocated to 4 Tampines Street 91 in the following year. At its inception, the school set out to create an inviting environment filled with care and strived to bring joy to children in their growth and learning. 

Operating as a single-session school since 2005, EVPS embraced the idea of ‘School in the Community and the Community in School’, partnering several community organisations to expand learning opportunities for students. For its partnership efforts, it was awarded the Ministry of Education’s Partners Award (Merit) in 2008. Living up to its image as a caring school, the School Advisory Committee introduced scholarship and bursary awards in 2011 for students who made significant academic improvements. In 2012, the school established the School-based Student Centre with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to support working parents. The Integrated Care Programme was initiated in 2014 to provide social care for at-risk students through the North East Community Development Council and the SSO (Social Services Office)@Tampines. 

The provision of a wholesome education in aesthetics was also a focus. In 2000, the school produced its first musical written by staff, entitled _Revelations._ The Learning for Life Programme for Music and Performing Arts was accorded to the school in 2015 for the delivery of holistic music education through drama, speech, movement, creation and improvisation.

A strong advocate for the environment, EVPS started its Green Programme by leveraging key partners to achieve the National Watermark Award in 2005. In 2015, it received the President’s Award for the Environment in recognition of its efforts to inculcate green habits in students, staff and the community. In developing students’ cognitive abilities, there was great emphasis on pedagogical practices that promoted engagement, understanding and independence. The focus on formative assessment, subject literacy, opening classroom talk and thinking strategies provided quality learning experiences. To further instill the joy of learning, the school implemented signature innovative initiatives such as E’joy, which had ICT (information and communications technology)-enabled math and science learning trails at the start of school terms; and ABCD (A Book Character Day), where staff and students dressed up as their favourite book characters.

In 2018, the school completed its final year with a heritage art piece, musical and a commemorative magazine to capture the 31 years of history and fond memories. In 2019, East View Primary School merged with Junyuan Primary School.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

East is the view with the rising sun<br>
Upward we shall move together as one<br>
With clear, alert and open minds<br>
We seek knowledge of many kinds<br>
To fulfill our duties we will strive<br>
To help and to share; to give, love and care<br>
With wisdom and knowledge we will grow<br>
To serve our nation in all that we do<br>
And so we progress and succeed<br>
Thro' endurance, harmony and unity<br>
With courage, virtue and honesty<br>
We'll look to the sunrise tomorrow

Chorus:<br>
To laugh or to cry<br>
To win or to lose<br>
We'll stand together, stand together one and all<br>
To East View Primary we belong<br>
For East View Primary sing out strong<br>
In East View Primary together we are one
