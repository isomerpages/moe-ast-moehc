#### **School Motto**
Live, Love, Learn and Make a difference

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/ecppri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The three full masts in red and turquoise form the acronym of the school name. They are set against the yellow rising sun to symbolise a ship, moving at full steam, appearing in the horizon. The school on its voyage in search of excellence and new frontiers is likened to the explorers of yore who possess great courage and the willingness to take risks.
