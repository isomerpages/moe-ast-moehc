#### **School History**
On 1 January 1950, the Department of Education (precursor of Ministry of Education) introduced a five-year plan to provide free and compulsory elementary education. Griffiths School was the first of 90 schools scheduled to be built under the plan in May 1950.

The school was originally named Towner Road School because of its location. As it was officially opened by the Rt. Hon. Mr James Griffiths, the then British Secretary for the Colonies, it was renamed Griffiths School in honour of him.

On 1 June 1950, the school enrolled its first batch of students. The average age of the students was 12, and many of them were from various vernacular and private schools. In the early 1950s, the school was mainly staffed by trainee teachers.

After Griffiths School closed in 1982, its students were transferred to Moulmein Primary School.

In 1988, a new Griffiths Primary school was re-established. Classes were held in Junyuan Primary School in the afternoon until 3 May that year, when the school moved to new premises at 3 Tampines Street 22. Griffiths Primary School was officially opened on 31 August 1990. To bridge the old and the new, the old Griffiths School song, school motto and school logo were retained.

PRIME upgrading for the school facilities was completed in 2002. In the following year, the architect won the Designshare merit award for educational facilities.

In 2007, the school clinched the second prize in the National Education Video Animation Competition with the entry, ‘Singapore Icon’.  It was the only entry from a primary school among others from Institutes of Technical Education and polytechnics.

On 19 April 2008, the school held the Celebrating Friendship Carnival to celebrate and strengthen bonds of the Griffiths community and to showcase the school’s strengths. It was a day of many firsts: Griffiths Joy Centre, an after-school care facility for students; Media Production Hub; and Family Life Centre were inaugurated that day.

On 1 January 2015, Griffiths Primary School and Qiaonan Primary School merged to form Angsana Primary School, functioning at the site of the former Griffiths Primary School site.
