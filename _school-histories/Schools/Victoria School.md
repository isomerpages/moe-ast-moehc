#### **School History**
Victoria School was established in 1876 as an English class in Kampong Glam Malay School. The Kampong Glam Malay Branch School aimed to help Malays benefit from English education. The first headmaster was Y.A. Yzelman, who organised and taught English to 12 Malay boys. Subsequently, under F.W. Hartley, new buildings were constructed in 1897 for better school facilities.

In 1900, the school moved to Syed Alwi Road, near Victoria Bridge. Hence the school became known as Victoria Bridge School. The first annual sports meet took place in 1915. In 1929, the house system was introduced and the house prefects were appointed in the following year. Until 1930, Victoria only had primary classes from Standard 1 to Standard 5. In 1931, the school became the second government secondary school in Singapore.

The school moved to Tyrwhitt Road in 1933 and was renamed Victoria School. In 1940, the prefect badge and school motto, ‘Nil Sine Labore’, were introduced. During the Japanese Occupation, the school was renamed Jalan Besar Boys’ School and reverted to its former name after the war. In 1951, Post School Certificate classes started. The school anthem was composed and set to music in the early 1950s. The school made great strides academically and in its extra-curricular activities. In 1979, Victoria School became a Pre-University Center, offering three-year pre-university courses. 

A new chapter began when Victoria Junior College was established in Marine Parade in 1984, and Victoria School moved to its Geylang Bahru site that same year. Victoria School launched its Art Elective Programme in 1985. Victoria Challenge, an event now fondly remembered by all Victorians, started in July 1987. In 1993, Victoria School was accorded autonomous status. The school hosted the Gifted Education Programme from 2001 to 2005.

In May 2003, Victoria School moved to its current premises at Siglap Link. In 2007, Victoria School became a pioneer in offering Physical Education as an O-Level subject. In 2008, the Ministry of Education introduced the Regional Studies Programme in four schools, with Victoria School being the only one offering Bahasa Indonesia as a third language. In 2012, Victoria School implemented the Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP) together with Cedar Girls’ Secondary School and Victoria Junior College. In 2013, Victoria School also began offering Secondary Three entry into the VCA IP. Today, the VCA partnership has broadened to include key areas such as co-curricular activities, talent development and student leadership.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/victoriasch1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The open book symbolises lifelong learning. The torch signifies truth and the passing on of a tradition. It also illuminates the way for Victorians who venture forth to excel beyond the shores of Singapore. The colour yellow symbolises dignity and excellence, while the colour red symbolises universal brotherhood and equality.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Victoria in Singapore,<br>
There are other schools we know,<br>
Victoria is something more,<br>
The school that watch'd us grow.

For here we've learnt and striven too.<br>
And played the sportsman's game;<br>
Victoria, we give to you<br>
The honour that you claim.

Victoria thy sons are we,<br>
And we will not forget,<br>
Victoria thy triumphs see,<br>
And victories we share yet.

For others came before and went,<br>
And carried to the world,<br>
Victoria's fame and our intent<br>
To keep her flag unfurled.
