#### **School History**
Anglican High School was founded in 1956 by the Chinese-speaking congregations of Anglican churches in Singapore. It was then the only Anglican school with Chinese as its medium of instruction compared to the others, which were English-medium schools.

It formally opened in January 1956, with a principal, three Chinese teachers, three English teachers, and 123 male students. Lessons were conducted in several classrooms of St Andrew’s Secondary School at Francis Thomas Drive.

The present Upper Changi Road site was later acquired. The first school building erected in 1960 comprised 16 classrooms, three science laboratories, an administration-cum-staff room, an assembly hall and the symbolic clock-tower.

The school became single-session in 1972 to provide a more enriching learning programme for its students from Secondary 1 to the pre-university level. The pre-university classes were phased out in 1978 with the establishment of junior colleges in Singapore. In 1979, the school was one of the nine Chinese schools selected for the Special Assistance Plan. This was based on the school’s consistent academic excellence, the school ethos, and its success in inculcating traditional values in the students.

The year 1995 marked another milestone for the school when it was granted the autonomous status by the Ministry of Education. In 2002, the school was upgraded with new classrooms, a library, computer labs and science labs. The Right Reverend John Chew, Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Singapore, officiated the opening of the new premises in 2005.

Anglican High School’s emphasis on holistic education has enabled the school to excel in both academic and co-curricular activities since its inception in 1956, a testament to the drive and passion of students and the dedication of teachers. In 2006, the school was designated the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Sports. In 2016, Anglican High School celebrated its 60th anniversary.
