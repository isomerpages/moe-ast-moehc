#### **School History**
In 2019, Yishun Junior College and Innova Junior College merged to form Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC), which combines the best programmes from both colleges.

As the Centre of Excellence for Digital Literacies, YIJC has a pervasive digital culture and is at the forefront of using information and communications technology in teaching and learning. To nurture future-ready leaders who can embrace state-of-the-art technology and harness the rich opportunities of the digital age, the college has developed a tiered programme to enhance students’ competencies in three distinct domains: digital productivity, citizenship and innovation. In addition, YIJC offers the Malay Language Elective Programme for those who wish to acquire a higher level of proficiency and a deeper understanding of the Malay language, literature and culture.

Adopting a structured leadership development approach of ‘assignments–relationships–courses’ for every student, YIJC aims to nurture future-ready leaders. Through the Talent Development Programme, the college recognises the potential of higher-achieving students and enhances their personal effectiveness through personal branding, personal statement writing, interview and networking skills to prepare them for university and scholarship applications.

To develop agile, confident individuals who can thrive in an increasingly complex setting, the Internationalisation Programme provides students with opportunities to venture beyond the classroom. These include immersing in a vibrant overseas learning environment or making a difference to the lives of others through values-in-action programmes.

Currently located at 3 Yishun Ring Road, the college will move to 21 Champions Way in 2025.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/yijc1.png" style="width:10%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest is a creative amalgamation of similar and unique elements of the crests of Yishun and Innova junior colleges. The design honours the heritage of both colleges while charting a shared future.

The prominent wave pattern represents the flame and wave emblems, which are significant elements of the identities of the former colleges. Embedded within the flame are the letters ‘Y’ and ‘I’ to represent how two different colleges can form a cohesive and distinctive identity together. The star is a key symbol in the crest and history of Innova Junior College. The pixelled sparks in the ‘YI’ flame form a star, representing the collaboration and commitment of both colleges to pursue a shared vision as one entity. The colours of red and blue are derived from the common college colours of maroon, navy and sky blue, but are new shades in the crest, signifying a fresh start for both colleges. The two colours are equally represented in the crest to show the unity of both colleges.

In a world of changes<br>
Where our values will define us<br>
We’ll uphold, noble goals<br>
Championing what we’ve learnt

We’ll always endeavour<br>
To ourselves we will be true<br>
We’ll aspire, our dreams afire<br>
Crafting worlds anew

We are Yishun Innova<br>
With passion we ignite<br>
Forging our own future<br>
Like the blazing flame, Y.I.

In our thoughts and our hearts<br>
With courage we will rise<br>
Leaning into our future<br>
Like a blazing flame, Y.I.
