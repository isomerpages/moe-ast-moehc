#### **School History**
Tampines Primary School was established in 1985. The following year, the school moved to its present location at Tampines Street 12.

In 2007, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, and became single-session in 2008. The school celebrated the completion of its new building in November 2009 with a homecoming walk.

As the first community school in Singapore, Tampines Primary School leverages on the use of community resources to enrich the students’ learning to contribute as concerned citizens. The partnership allows a cohesive and caring culture to take place among the communities in Tampines West. Leveraging its culture of excellence, the school was conferred the School Distinction Award in 2010 and 2014.  These achievements are the results of a shared vision and strong collaboration between school, stakeholders and partners.
