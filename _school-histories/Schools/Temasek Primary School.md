#### **School History**
Temasek Primary School began holding classes at the premises of Bedok View Primary School in 1979. The school started functioning on 2 January 1980 at Chai Chee along New Upper Changi Road with 2,200 students formerly from various schools. Temasek Primary School moved to its current premises at Bedok South Avenue 3 in December 2000, and the new campus was officially opened on 19 April 2002. As part of PERI upgrading, an indoor sports hall was completed in 2014. The school operated as single-session from January 2015.

Recognised for its organisational excellence, the school has attained the Singapore Quality Class, School Distinction Award, Best Practices Award in Teaching and Learning and Staff Well-Being as well as awarded the Sustained Achievement Award in Physical Fitness, the Character Development Award, CHERISH Gold Award, Outstanding Partnership Award and the National Arts Education Glow Award. Moreover, the school has produced 10 Prime Minister Book Prize winners, 3 staff members who were conferred the President’s Award for Teachers and 2 teachers awarded the Outstanding Youth in Education Award.

Temasek Primary aspires to be the best learning campus in the eastern part of Singapore, where its students are provided with a holistic education through a wide range of learning experiences. Under the leadership of past and present principals, the school has grown in strength and accomplishments over the years. A shared belief in stretching the boundary of possibilities has helped to shape the school into what it is today and provided Temasek Primary with a distinct heritage as well as made it the school of choice in the community. Its success in both the academic and co-curricular programmes is attributed to the concerted effort put in by its students and teachers, with strong support from the parents and community.
