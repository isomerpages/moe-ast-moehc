#### **School History**
Established in the 1950s, Seraya Primary School was located on Seraya Road. The school shared a field with its neighbour, Fowlie School.  
  
In 1986, Seraya Primary School merged with Fowlie School to form Fowlie Primary School. Fowlie Primary School occupied the site of both of its former schools. The new Fowlie Primary School retained Seraya Primary School’s flaming torch and four rings in its school crest.  
  
In 2001, Fowlie Primary School merged with Haig Boys’ Primary School and Mountbatten Primary School to form Tanjong Katong Primary School. Since 2001, the former site of Seraya School has been used to house Tanjong Katong Primary School.
