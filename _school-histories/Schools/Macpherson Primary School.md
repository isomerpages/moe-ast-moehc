#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/macphersonpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school logo incorporates both the traditional and the modern. It consists of the traditional shield to depict the school as one with a history. On the right of the shield is the name of the school in contemporary font. This signifies the school as one that is forward-looking and innovative, with a desire to prepare its students for the future. The school aims to be the choice school of the new millennium.

The five golden stars represent the holistic development of our students in the following areas: academic, physical education/co-curricular activities, moral, social and aesthetics.

Stars are embedded in a white arrow pointing towards the golden lion. The arrow symbolises the staff, students, parents and the community working together as a team in achieving the five-fold development of the students towards the school’s vision, as symbolised by the golden lion.

The golden lion symbolises the school vision of being ‘A Learning Institute of Distinction’, as the school works together as a team, as symbolised by the white arrow, to develop students to the fullest. The lion has his right arm raised, signifying the school’s daring to ask, learn and innovate.

Red, being a symbol of passion, describes the attitude in which the school works and nurtures its students to have:
*   passion for learning
*   passion for its country
*   compassion for humanity

The golden banner with the school motto ‘NOBILITY, HONOUR, EXCELLENCE’ symbolises the values that are instill in the students in thoughts, words and deeds.

The year 1966 is when the school was established.
