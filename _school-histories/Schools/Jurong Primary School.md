#### **School History**
Jurong Primary School was formed through the merger of Jurong Primary School and Boon Lay Primary School in 2006. The merged school occupied the location of Boon Lay Primary School at Jurong East Street 32 while retaining the name of Jurong Primary School. It embraces the rich traditions, history and heritage of the two schools.&nbsp;

In 1950, Jurong Road School was built along Old Jurong Road with an enrolment of 100 students, three teachers and Mr Phoa Hock Seng as its first principal. The school was renamed Jurong Morning School in 1954, and the following year became known as Jurong School I and II. By then, the enrolment had grown to 318 students with a staff of 16 teachers. Majority of the students came from the nearby farming communities.&nbsp;

The school’s intake grew to 1,510 students in 38 classes and had two sessions by 1983. On 1 January 1985, Jurong Primary School relocated to a new site at Jurong East Avenue 1. The school was also gaining recognition for its academic and co-curricular achievements in the 1990s.

In 2006, Boon Lay Primary School merged with Jurong Primary School with a combined enrolment of about 2,500 students. The school campus underwent a major revamp and upgrading under PRIME. With the humble beginnings of both schools more than half a century ago, Jurong Primary School has evolved to be one of the most reputable schools in Jurong today, building a vibrant community of gracious citizens and passionate learners.
