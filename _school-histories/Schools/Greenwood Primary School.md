#### **School History**
Greenwood Primary School was established in 2000, and classes were held in Woodgrove Primary School for a year. The school began operations at its current premises at Woodlands Drive 62 in January 2001 as a double-session school.

Greenwood Primary was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, WHIZZ (We are THinking,&nbsp;Inventive and&nbsp;Zealous KidZ&nbsp;to Serve the Community), in 2014. This programme focuses on character and leadership education, providing a moral compass for students to overcome challenges in the ever-changing global landscape. Opportunities and scenarios within and outside classrooms are created to allow students to work in groups and apply&nbsp;Appreciative Inquiry, Systems Thinking, the Six Thinking Hats, the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle and Design Thinking as intentional processes to relate to the real world and derive new, relevant solutions that would have a positive impact on society.

To encourage effective bilingual competencies in students, the school developed the Applied Learning Programme, BLISS (Bilingual&nbsp;Literature ApprecIation&nbsp;Student&nbsp;Series), in 2016. Through BLISS, students practise Socratic Questioning and Philosophy for Children (P4C) to develop their critical thinking, collaborative, communication and information skills. The texts used during BLISS lessons allow students to apply reasoning and argumentative skills to construct meaning and opinions, linking these to societal concerns in the real world.

A new and exciting millennium dawns<br>
And Greenwood Primary emerges<br>
To take us into a future that’s bright<br>
To help us through tomorrow’s challenges<br>
United we’ll stay, in good times and in bad<br>
With hearts and minds focused and strong<br>
We learn to honour, to love and to care<br>
Because to Greenwood we all belong!

Tall as the trees in the woods, we’ll stand<br>
As Greenwood’s family, we’ll walk hand in hand<br>
We think and we learn, as we grow day by day<br>
Giving of our best at work and at play<br>
Our school’s mission will then come alive<br>
Our motto too – for together we will strive<br>
Success and glory to Greenwood bring<br>
With joy in our hearts for Greenwood we sing!

To show respect and gratitude too<br>
At home to parents and to teachers at school<br>
To be a friend to those in need<br>
A helping hand, a little kind deed<br>
To use with care, resources of our land<br>
We know for ourselves, we have to fend<br>
Steadfast and proud, in a citizen’s role<br>
Our Nation’s name, to cherish and uphold.
