#### **School History**
Greenwood Primary School was established in 2000, and classes were held in Woodgrove Primary School for a year. The school began operations at its current premises at Woodlands Drive 62 in January 2001 as a double-session school.

Greenwood Primary was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, WHIZZ (We are THinking, Inventive and Zealous KidZ to Serve the Community), in 2014. This programme focuses on character and leadership education, providing a moral compass for students to overcome challenges in the ever-changing global landscape. Opportunities and scenarios within and outside classrooms are created to allow students to work in groups and apply Appreciative Inquiry, Systems Thinking, the Six Thinking Hats, the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle and Design Thinking as intentional processes to relate to the real world and derive new, relevant solutions that would have a positive impact on society.

To encourage effective bilingual competencies in students, the school developed the Applied Learning Programme, BLISS (Bilingual Literature ApprecIation Student Series), in 2016. Through BLISS, students practise Socratic Questioning and Philosophy for Children (P4C) to develop their critical thinking, collaborative, communication and information skills. The texts used during BLISS lessons allow students to apply reasoning and argumentative skills to construct meaning and opinions, linking these to societal concerns in the real world.
