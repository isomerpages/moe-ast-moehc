#### **School History**
Pioneer Junior College (PJC) was established in 1999 and welcomed its first cohort of students on 2 January 2000. Originally located at a holding site along Science Centre Road, the college moved into its permanent home at 21 Teck Whye Walk in 2004.

PJC sought to develop every student to his/her fullest potential. The college upheld the twin pillars of academic excellence and character development, and grew from strength to strength to become a safe abode for a community of committed learners and compassionate leaders. The love and care from its teachers touched the hearts of many students. The efforts won the parents’ affirmation for and trust in the college as an institution that put students at the heart of education and enabled them to excel above expectations.

In 2007, the college organised the Ministry of Education (MOE) Pre-University Seminar, which saw the inaugural participation of polytechnics and Integrated Programme schools, marking a milestone in the history of the seminar. In the following year, PJC launched the Engaging China Programme, forging collaborations with top Chinese universities as well as partnerships with Chinese educational institutions and companies. The programme was further augmented with the introduction of a new A-Level subject, China Studies in English, and the development of the China Ready Index tool by the college. In 2012, the college became the third JC centre for the Malay Language Elective Programme.

In 2019, PJC merged with Jurong Junior College and became known as Jurong Pioneer Junior College. In its relatively short 19 years, PJC achieved outstanding outcomes, with its efforts recognised by notable awards: Sustained Achievement Award for Academic Value-Added (since 2009), Outstanding Development in Character Development (2010), Best Practice Award for Teaching and Learning (2010), School Distinction Award (2010) and Outstanding Development Award for National Education (2012). The college also produced four Public Service Commission scholars and a President’s Scholar, inspiring generations of Pioneers to achieve goals once thought unsurmountable.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Kwek Hiok Chuang (2000–2004)<br>
\- Mrs Tan-Kek Lee Yong (2005–2018)

#### **School Motto**
While I Live, I Learn

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/pioneerjc1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The PJC logo represents the emergence of a new spirit of creativity and flexibility. The right angles symbolise the virtues of integrity and fortitude, while the obtuse angles, as well as the protruding edge, signify the students’ willingness to expand their thinking beyond the bounds of accepted practices by adopting a spirit of adventure and entrepreneurship.

The upward thrust of the two coloured bands points to the eagerness of the individual to look ahead to the future, while being anchored firmly in the core values of the past. The two bands meet at a 62-degree angle, representing the 62 teaching and non-teaching staff who started the college in 1999. 

The image of a blank, white canvas epitomises the attitude of openness with which students accept different perspectives. The charcoal colour connotes the ‘fuel of knowledge’. As fuel is burnt, the ‘fires of learning’, as represented by the vermilion colour, are ignited. This fire burns with youthful energy and passion, attributes that students must possess as they forge ahead with a pioneering spirit.

Here I stand<br>
The dawning of a brand new day<br>
As I look to the way ahead<br>
In my heart burns the fire of learning<br>
And it shines everywhere I go<br>
Never fading and ever yearning<br>
While I live, I learn and grow

I will seek and explore<br>
Open each and every door<br>
Always caring and faithful and true<br>
To be a guiding light<br>
Set the future shining bright<br>
For my college and for nation too<br>
I am a true Pioneer<br>
Crossing every new frontier<br>
With conviction I take every turn<br>
This passion I will hold<br>
So that everyone may know<br>
I believe: While I live, I learn

Here we stand<br>
Together on this special day<br>
Pioneers who will lead the way<br>
All our hearts share the spirit of exploring<br>
In our lives we will always show<br>
How we've set our sights on soaring<br>
While we live, we learn and grow

And we'll seek and explore<br>
Open each and every door<br>
Always caring and faithful and true<br>
To be a guiding light<br>
Set the future shining bright<br>
For our college and for nation too<br>
Yes, we are true Pioneers<br>
Crossing all the new frontiers<br>
With conviction we take every turn<br>
This passion we will hold<br>
So that everyone may know<br>
We believe: While we live, we learn
