#### **School History**
Pioneer Junior College (PJC) was established in 1999 and welcomed its first cohort of students on 2 January 2000. Originally located at a holding site along Science Centre Road, the college moved into its permanent home at 21 Teck Whye Walk in 2004.

PJC sought to develop every student to his/her fullest potential. The college upheld the twin pillars of academic excellence and character development, and grew from strength to strength to become a safe abode for a community of committed learners and compassionate leaders. The love and care from its teachers touched the hearts of many students. The efforts won the parents’ affirmation for and trust in the college as an institution that put students at the heart of education and enabled them to excel above expectations.

In 2007, the college organised the Ministry of Education (MOE) Pre-University Seminar, which saw the inaugural participation of polytechnics and Integrated Programme schools, marking a milestone in the history of the seminar. In the following year, PJC launched the Engaging China Programme, forging collaborations with top Chinese universities as well as partnerships with Chinese educational institutions and companies. The programme was further augmented with the introduction of a new A-Level subject, China Studies in English, and the development of the China Ready Index tool by the college. In 2012, the college became the third JC centre for the Malay Language Elective Programme.

In 2019, PJC merged with Jurong Junior College and became known as Jurong Pioneer Junior College. In its relatively short 19 years, PJC achieved outstanding outcomes, with its efforts recognised by notable awards: Sustained Achievement Award for Academic Value-Added (since 2009), Outstanding Development in Character Development (2010), Best Practice Award for Teaching and Learning (2010), School Distinction Award (2010) and Outstanding Development Award for National Education (2012). The college also produced four Public Service Commission scholars and a President’s Scholar, inspiring generations of Pioneers to achieve goals once thought unsurmountable.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Kwek Hiok Chuang (2000–2004)<br>
\- Mrs Tan-Kek Lee Yong (2005–2018)
