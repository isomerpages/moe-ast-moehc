#### **School History**
Boon Lay Secondary School was established in 1977 as a government co-educational school. It started with two mediums of instruction: English and Chinese. In 1988, it became a solely English-medium, double-session school. In November 1999, the school relocated to its current premises at 11 Jurong West Street 65. In January 2000, Boon Lay became a single-session school.

In January 2017, Boon Lay Secondary School merged with Pioneer Secondary School, with the former retaining its name. In the same year, Boon Lay Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Exploring Possibilities with Materials Science’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘INSPIRE@BLS’ (Igniting Students’ Passion and Interests through Arts-related Experiences). In addition, the school implemented the ‘co-curricular activity (CCA)-centric’ concept where students are organised according to CCA families in place of the form class.&nbsp;

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/boonlaysec1.jpg">

The school crest features the profiles of two persons united as one, moving on an upward path towards their aspirations. Launched in November 2016, the school crest marks the merger of Pioneer Secondary and Boon Lay Secondary from 2017 onwards. It represents the teacher and student walking hand in hand as part of an extended family working together, creating possibilities for students to realise their dreams.

The ladder-like design represents success in the pursuit of wisdom and the ideals of the school. It is a clarion call to endeavour and aspire towards greater heights while honouring and treasuring heritage. ‘BLS’ is the acronym for Boon Lay Secondary. Accompanying the school crest, the Chinese name of the school 文礼中学 reflects the Chinese heritage of Boon Lay Secondary when it began in 1977 as a bilingual school offering both Chinese and English as the medium of instruction.
