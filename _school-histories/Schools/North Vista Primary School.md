#### **School History**
  
North Vista Primary School, a government co-educational institution, was established in 2008 at Compassvale Link and officially inaugurated on 24 September 2010. The school has quickly emerged as a hub of innovation and creativity.

In 2013, North Vista was awarded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Visual Arts, highlighting its commitment to fostering artistic talents among students. Building on this foundation, the school introduced the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in 2014, focused on 'Nurturing Future-Ready Digital Creators,' which has equipped students with critical digital skills and a forward-thinking mindset.

2017 marked the school's 10th anniversary, a significant milestone celebrated with great enthusiasm and pride. That same year, North Vista commenced its PERI (Primary Education Review and Implementation) upgrading, a comprehensive enhancement initiative aimed at improving the school's facilities and learning environment.

Since the introduction of its LLP and ALP, North Vista Primary School has been dedicated to continuously reviewing and refining these programmes to ensure that the curriculum remains closely aligned with students' interests and the evolving demands of the future.

#### **School Motto**
Utmost, Highest, Noblest

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/northvistapri1.png">

The school crest consists of a shield that frames the globe, signifying earth, with the horizon and the sky in the background. The green part of the globe stands for the school’s pride in the land and its care for the environment. The blue emphasises its identity to be rooted in the country, with a global outlook, always searching for new possibilities beyond the shores and the horizons of the future. The students are the sons and daughters of a new generation, creating their own future. It also symbolises its organisation as the school of the future, boldly looking forward, creating new possibilities and opening new doors of opportunities for its students.

The white road signifies the responsibility of the school in guiding its students on the road towards the True North, symbolised by the huge golden North Star. The colour white symbolises purity and virtue. The students are imbued with the values that will stand them in good stead for the future. The white road also gives the school its identity as it divides the globe into ‘N’ and ‘V’, which stands for ‘North Vista’.

The five golden stars next to the True North represent the holistic development of its students in the cognitive, physical, moral, social and aesthetic aspects.

The crown on top of the shield symbolises its emphasis on being a community of learners where its people learn as one, and each is responsible for his or her own learning and the learning of the community. Its people are its pride and they are the crown of the school.

The laurels, at both sides of the shield, symbolise the spirit of excellence that the school possesses in all its endeavours. The school always gives its best and ensure that the best is given.

The banner that carries its call, ‘UTMOST, HIGHEST, NOBLEST’ symbolises the virtues that the school instills in its students – Utmost in Deeds, Highest in Love, Noblest in Aspirations.
