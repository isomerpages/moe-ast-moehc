#### **School Motto**
Utmost, Highest, Noblest

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/northvistapri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest consists of a shield that frames the globe, signifying earth, with the horizon and the sky in the background. The green part of the globe stands for the school’s pride in the land and its care for the environment. The blue emphasises its identity to be rooted in the country, with a global outlook, always searching for new possibilities beyond the shores and the horizons of the future. The students are the sons and daughters of a new generation, creating their own future. It also symbolises its organisation as the school of the future, boldly looking forward, creating new possibilities and opening new doors of opportunities for its students.

The white road signifies the responsibility of the school in guiding its students on the road towards the True North, symbolised by the huge golden North Star. The colour white symbolises purity and virtue. The students are imbued with the values that will stand them in good stead for the future. The white road also gives the school its identity as it divides the globe into ‘N’ and ‘V’, which stands for ‘North Vista’.

The five golden stars next to the True North represent the holistic development of its students in the cognitive, physical, moral, social and aesthetic aspects.

The crown on top of the shield symbolises its emphasis on being a community of learners where its people learn as one, and each is responsible for his or her own learning and the learning of the community. Its people are its pride and they are the crown of the school.

The laurels, at both sides of the shield, symbolise the spirit of excellence that the school possesses in all its endeavours. The school always gives its best and ensure that the best is given.

The banner that carries its call, ‘UTMOST, HIGHEST, NOBLEST’ symbolises the virtues that the school instills in its students – Utmost in Deeds, Highest in Love, Noblest in Aspirations.
