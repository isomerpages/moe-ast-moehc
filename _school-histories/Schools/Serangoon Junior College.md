#### **School History**
Established in March 1988, Serangoon Junior College (SRJC) began operations from temporary premises in Hougang. With a pioneering staff of 45 teachers, lessons for the first batch of 673 students commenced in April that year. In December 1990, the college relocated to its present campus on Upper Serangoon Road and was officially declared open on 29 May 1992.  

As the 14th junior college established in Singapore, SRJC progressed rapidly through the years. Despite its humble beginnings, SRJCians have achieved admirable academic and non-academic outcomes. In 1994, SRJC graduate Mr Paul Khoo was the first winner of the Angus Ross Literature Prize from Cambridge University, a significant achievement from a then relatively new college. In 2015, Ms Annabelle Ng, who has been an avid canoeist since she was a student in SRJC, won the gold award at the SEA Games competition.

Over the years, SRJC has emphasised the importance of broadening the students’ global outlook and character development, providing a holistic educational experience for all students. Through the various key events and signature programmes, SRJCians get to ‘Learn, Lead and Serve’.

In 2006, SRJCians built Singapore’s longest sandcastle and raised $50,000 for Tan Tock Seng Hospital through the Sands of Mission project. In 2007, the biennial Thanksgiving Concert was incepted to celebrate fundraising efforts. Since then, it has evolved to become a concert performed by staff to motivate students for their end-of-year examinations. In 2008, the annual WILL Run was inaugurated with the objective of conquering one’s physical limits and raising funds for charity. In the same year, the Serangoon Junior College Global Classroom Experience commenced to provide students with opportunities to learn and serve beyond the shores of Singapore. In 2009, Camp ASPIRE was launched to provide a common training experience for all student leaders. In 2011, the ACE@SRJC programme was started to offer higher-ability students opportunities to fulfil their potential and contribute to the community.

In 2017, it was announced that SRJC would merge with Anderson Junior College, operating under the name of Anderson Serangoon Junior College in 2019. In 2018, the college celebrated its 30th anniversary and vacated from its premises on Upper Serangoon Road.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/serangoonjc1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The lion stands for courage and nationhood. The flame stands for enlightenment, and the laurel leaves represent achievement. The college colours are red, gold and green. Red represents dignity and warmth – every student should be dignified and have warmth for their fellow men. Gold represents goodness and purity – students shall be individuals of good character and convictions. Green represents youth with a thirst for knowledge and an eagerness to learn.
