<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Montfort Secondary School started as a single class of students in rural
Serangoon in 1916. Father Laurent, parish priest of Serangoon, laid the
foundation for a two-storey school building between the parish church and
his presbytery. His successor, Father H. Duvelle, started a Chinese class
on the ground floor and an English class on the upper floor.</p>
<p>In 1920, a dynamic priest, Father E. Becheras, arrived to take over as
parish priest of Serangoon. He immediately set about gathering students
for the school. It was no easy task as people in the area, who were mostly
farmers and fishermen, did not see the need for education. Undaunted, Father
Becheras went house to house persuading parents to send their sons to the
school, and succeeded in doing so. From 1922 to 1936, Mr P.A. D’Costa,
the school’s first headmaster, helped Father Becheras run the school.</p>
<p>In 1936, Bishop A. Devals, the Bishop of Singapore and Malaya, invited
the Brothers of St Gabriel to run the Parish School. Brother Gerard Majella
and Brother Louis Gonzaga were among the first Brothers to arrive in Singapore
to implement the Gabrielite approach to education.</p>
<p>The Second World War interrupted the functioning of the school, but Brother
Louis Gonzaga returned to restart classes immediately after the war. Numerous
building extensions were made subsequently. In 1959, Holy Innocents’ English
School was renamed Montfort School to honour St Louis Marie Grignion de
Montfort, whose efforts to educate youths were continued by the Brothers
of St Gabriel. In the 1960s, Montfort School was noted for offering a quality
holistic education in Upper Serangoon. By 1972, the enrolment at Montfort
was 2,635 students with classes from Primary One to Pre-University Two.
The primary section was separated from the main school in 1974 and became
a school in its own right known as Montfort Junior School.</p>
<p>In 1984, the Old Montfortian Association, led by its President, Mr Lim
Boon Heng, spearheaded efforts to rebuild Montfort, so that it would be
comparable to the new government schools. In January 1992, Montfort started
functioning at its new premises as two separate secondary and primary schools.
At the end of 2009, Montfort Secondary School underwent PRIME upgrading.
In January 2012, Montfort Secondary School returned to its Hougang location.</p>
<p>The school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in information systems technology
and design aims to provide students with foundational skills in this frontier
learning domain. Montfort’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is centred
on leadership development through sports (badminton, softball and football)
and outdoor education, where the boys hone their leadership skills through
various classes, co-curricular and school activities, embarking on meaningful
community and school projects. The school’s ALP and LLP are evident of
the school’s commitment to the holistic development of its students. In
2016, Montfort celebrated its 100th anniversary.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Age Quod Agis</p>
<p>(Latin for ‘Do well in whatever you do’)</p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>The school crest was created when the Brothers of St Gabriel took over
the management of the school in 1936. In 2014, the current crest was adopted,
in line with the rest of the schools around the world which are under the
Brothers.</p>
<p>The coat of arms has the letters ‘AM’ in the top-left quadrant, which
stand for ‘Ave Maria’ (Latin for ‘Hail Mary’), and a lily, which symbolises
the purity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, to whom the founder of the Order
of St Gabriel, St Louis Marie de Montfort, was devoted.</p>
<p>God was the sole motivating force in the life of St Louis Marie de Montfort.
This is symbolised by the cross with the letters ‘DS’ in the bottom-right
quadrant, which stand for ‘Dieu Seul’ (French for ‘God Alone’).</p>
<p>The image of a star in the bottom-left quadrant symbolises the guidance
of the Blessed Virgin Mary on life’s journey. Perseverance in the face
of the storms of life is symbolised by the image of a sailboat in the top-right
quadrant. ‘Our Lady, Star of the Sea’ is another title given to the Blessed
Virgin Mary, who is the guiding star.</p>
<p>The crest also has the words ‘Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel’ and ‘Labor
Omnia Vincit’ (Latin for ‘Labour conquers all things’) on it.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>School Song</strong></h4>
<p>All ye sons of Montfort School</p>
<p>Ever grateful be and true</p>
<p>To your Alma Mater dear</p>
<p>For her loving care of you.</p>
<p>Keep your filial piety</p>
<p>Burning bright your whole life through,</p>
<p>Ever jealous of her name</p>
<p>Ever mindful of her claim.</p>
<p>Hark! Her bugle sounds aloud,</p>
<p>Rise her sons, and play your part</p>
<p>With a song upon your lips</p>
<p>And a courage in your heart.</p>
<p>See! Her banner in the breeze,</p>
<p>Freely flutters high and smart</p>
<p>Feel in you a surging pride</p>
<p>When your Mater’s colours ride.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
