<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Established as the first secondary school in Tampines New Town, PRSS’s
mission is deeply influenced by the sense of responsibility in providing
quality secondary education to the Tampines community. It had its humble
beginnings on 2nd January 1985 at Chongzheng Primary School, the temporary
premise, with 11 Secondary One classes and 16 teaching staff. On 8th April
1985, the staff and students moved into the new school building.</p>
<p>In 2006, the school underwent PRIME (Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving
Existing schools) and moved back to its present campus which was completed
in 2008. The new campus was officially opened on 8 August 2008</p>
<p>PRSS was recognized as a niche school for Chinese Orchestra (CO) in 2008.
The niche area evolved into Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Music
and Performing Arts in June 2014 with an established Cultural Fusion Programme
complemented by 5 performing arts CCAs including the Choir, Concert Band,
Chinese Orchestra and Malay Dance. The LLP framework - SHINE@PRSS, augments
the inculcation of values in students, develops their socio-emotional competencies
and allows for the acquisition of important life skills through Music and
Performing Arts.</p>
<p>The Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Project DRIVE@PRSS was introduced
in Jan 2014 to develop critical thinking and 21st Century Competencies.
The ALP provides students with the opportunities to relate learning to
real-life, increase their awareness of local and global issues and enhance
their media literacy skills through broadcasting journalism. In 2019, the
ALP was revised to “Eye On the World: Stories through journalism” to deepen
the students’ interest in contemporary issues and appreciation of the English
Language and Humanities through broadcast journalism and photo journalism
as digital learners.</p>
<p>In tandem with the evolving educational landscape, the school has implemented
new initiatives to improve the quality of education over the years. In
2019, the school piloted 1:1 computing (Personal Digital Learning Programme)
where every sec 1 student was assigned a Chromebook with consultancy from
ETD. This will be scaled up for all levels by 2022. Guided by its mission
“Inspiring Lives, Nurturing Talents, Realising Dreams”, the school continues
to inspire and nurture every Pasirian to be grounded on core value, equipped
with 21CC, to navigate the complexities in life and contribute to the Singapore
Story.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Pride and Responsibility</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>The school crest reflects the type of education, which the school aims
to provide its students. The motto, Pride and Responsibility, derived from
the initials of the school, are the solid values, which the school hope
to instill in students. These virtues, like sails in the wind, will carry
the school forward to success and work excellence.</p>
<p>The waves which form the base on which Pride and Responsibility rests,
symbolises the students' aesthetic and moral development which complement
their formal education.</p>
<p>The school colours, yellow and green, are indicative of the freshness
and enlightenment that a sound education provides. It is therefore the
school's aspiration to provide the best possible education for its students
so as to ensure that our future generation of citizens will show pride
and responsibilities in their endeavours.</p>
