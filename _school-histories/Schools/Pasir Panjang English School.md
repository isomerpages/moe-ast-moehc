<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Pasir Panjang English School was established in 1933 as one of the earliest
government English schools in Pasir Panjang, during a period of rapid expansion
of the English education system prior to World War II.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The road leading up to the school was subsequently named after philanthropist
Chia Yew Siang, whose land was acquired for its site. It offered education
leading to the Cambridge School Certificate and participated in an early
co-educational trial in 1936 together with two other government English
schools<s>,</s> that was reported as successful in the newspapers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before the war in December 1941, the school also functioned as an evacuation
registration centre. Although destroyed during the war, the school was
rebuilt by 1948.</p>
<p>In 1954, the school was renamed Pasir Panjang School I and eventually
became known as Pasir Panjang Primary School before closing in 1986, with
students transferring to Jagoh Primary School.</p>
<p>The premises were later repurposed in 1999 as a drug rehabilitation centre
until 2024.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school has also produced many notable students including Emeritus
Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, national sprinter Mr C Kunalan, Dr Tan Eng
Liang, who was Senior Minister of State for National Development and national
water polo player, and Dr Cham Tao Soon, the founding President of Nanyang
Technological Institute (NTI) and President of Nanyang Technological University
(NTU).</p>
