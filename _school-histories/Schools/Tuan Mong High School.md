#### **School History**
Tuan Mong School was established in 1906 at Hill Street as a primary school.

Founded by the&nbsp;_Kongsi_&nbsp;(clan associations established by the&nbsp;_Teochews_&nbsp;during the colonial period), the school started with two teachers and 68 students. The school moved to Tank Road in 1918.

In 1953, Ngee Ann&nbsp;_Kongsi_&nbsp;took over the management of Tuan Mong School. The school was renamed “Tuan Mong High School” in 1955 when secondary level classes started. In 1957, Tuan Mong High School became government-aided school. A year later, the school also included pre-university classes.

When the new four-storey school building was completed in 1963, the school occupied the three upper floors of the building before moving to the new campus in 1968. Tuan Mong High School became an integrated school in 1980 when it started four English stream classes of Secondary One.

Over the years, Tuan Mong High School was recognised for her students’ sporting and cultural achievements, especially Chinese calligraphy. In 1981, the school held a Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition as well as a Variety Concert at the Victoria Theatre to celebrate the school’s 75th anniversary.

When Tuan Mong High School was closed in 1994, Ngee Ann&nbsp;_Kongsi_&nbsp;proposed&nbsp;to set up Ngee Ann secondary school (with a successive link to the existing Ngee Ann Primary) to continue educating and nurturing youth for the new generation.

Ngee Ann secondary school was then set up in 1994 with 15 Secondary One classes and an enrolment of around 600 pupils.&nbsp; In June of the same year, the school moved to its new premises in Tampines.
