#### **School History**
Established in 1982, Bowen Secondary School began operations in the growing new town of Ang Mo Kio. In December 1999, Bowen Secondary School relocated to its current premises at 2 Lorong Napiri. In the following year, Bowen Secondary School became a single-session school.

In 2014, Bowen was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in community and youth leadership, and the Applied Learning Programme in business and entrepreneurship. In 2018, the school brought the two programmes together under its flagship ChANgeMakers programme. ChANgeMakers continues to nurture a spirit of service and empathy in every Bowenian, with authentic opportunities every year to learn, serve as well as engage in design thinking.

#### **School Motto**
I Believe, Therefore I am.

The school believes that students will fulfil their aspirations when they believe in their own abilities and are determined to strive for success.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bowensec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The Bowen crest comprises six arrows converging to form a star. The star faces upwards and onwards to denote students’ self-belief and aspirations. The six arrows represent the core values: respect, responsibility, resilience, compassion, teamwork and excellence. The school colours of blue and purple represent youth and passion.
