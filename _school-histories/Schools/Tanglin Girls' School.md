#### **School History**
Tanglin Girls’ School was established in 1957. Most of the initial students were transferred from Birkhall morning and afternoon schools, Bukit Merah North School, Bukit Merah South School and Redhill School.

In 1985, Tanglin Girls’ School merged with Kay Siang Primary School to form Xianglin Primary School. Xianglin Primary School combined the premises of Tanglin Girls’ School and Kay Siang Primary School, which were located next to each other.

In 1987, Xianglin Primary School merged with Belvedere Primary School. The new school was named Belvedere Primary School and was located in Xianglin Primary School's building. In 1990, following the closure of Belvedere Primary School, office buildings were built on Xianglin Primary School’s site. Currently, the site hosts the Singapore Environment Council, Executive Counselling &amp; Training Academy and Stanford Academy.
