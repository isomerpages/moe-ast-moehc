#### **School History**
Ghim Moh Primary School was officially declared open on 16 February 1979. The school was built to meet the needs of the residents in Ghim Moh housing estate.

In 1982, the school began a quarterly magazine called&nbsp;_Busy Times_, which aimed to promote good reading and writing skills of its students. In 1985, the school produced a souvenir edition,&nbsp;_The Best of_&nbsp;_Busy Times_, for its National Day celebrations.

The school had an Engage in Creating Orchid Hybrids (ECOH) programme that fostered creativity and experiential learning which, facilitated scientific thinking and processing skills in students. In September 2005, the programme produced a few orchid hybrids. The best hybrid was named Dendrobium Royal Ghim Moh Primary, after the school.

In 2009, Ghim Moh Primary School merged with New Town Primary School.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/ghimmohpri1.png">

The letter&nbsp;**G**&nbsp;in the crest represents the good education, good work attitude and good recreation, which students receive from the school and which promote good health and positive social behaviour.

These aspirations rest on a solid foundation – the letter&nbsp;**M**&nbsp;in the crest is a stylised figure of a Minangkabau house, a very strong and reliable house built without the use of a single nail.

#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>
	

Ghim Moh, it is our second home<br>
A beacon to us all<br>
It lights our hearts<br>
It lights our minds<br>
And gives us all that’s good.

**Chorus**<br>
Let us come with open minds<br>
Let us come with open hands<br>
To give and to take<br>
Let us try to better ourselves<br>
In work and in play.

In school we find our teachers, friends<br>
And rules to guide us by<br>
We find friendship, we find much joy<br>
And lessons to enjoy.
