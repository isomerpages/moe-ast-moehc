#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Keppel School was located at Cantonment Road. Its students were temporarily housed in Gan Eng Seng School, before moving into its own school building at Cantonment Road.  
  
In 1984, Keppel School merged with its neighbour, Cantonment School, to form Keppel Primary School. The newly amalgamated school was housed in the combined premises of the former two schools. When Keppel Primary School closed in 1996, the remaining students of Keppel Primary School were transferred to Zhangde Primary School.  
  
From 1996 to 2004, the Keppel Primary School building was used as the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau office. The building was subsequently demolished. Since 2004, the former site of the school has been used for private business offices.

#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>	

Letâ€™s all join in and happily sing<br>
A gay and lively tune<br>
To our beloved Keppel School<br>
Where multi-racial pupils free<br>
All learn to write and read

Happy are we in Keppel School<br>
Wearing our uniform white and blue<br>
Hard work we give and rules obey<br>
That Keppel School may shine<br>
From day to day

Through games and sports we learn to be<br>
So disciplined and tough<br>
To build a country rugged enough<br>
Our loyalty we give to the state and school<br>
To principal and teachers too.
