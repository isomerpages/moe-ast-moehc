The school was officially declared open by then Member of Parliament for River Valley, Mr Lim Cheng Lock. The school offered lessons in both English and Chinese mediums. In the 1970s, the school building was concurrently used by the Adult Education Board Centre.  
  
In 1984, Kim Keat Primary School closed. The remaining students in Kim Keat Primary School were transferred to Moulmein Primary School. The school building remained vacant for several years.
