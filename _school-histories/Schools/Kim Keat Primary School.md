#### **School History**
Established in 1963, Kim Keat Primary School, also known as Kim Keat Integrated School,was located along Kim Keat Road. The school was officially declared open by then Member of Parliament for River Valley, Mr Lim Cheng Lock. The school offered lessons in both English and Chinese mediums. In the 1970s, the school building was concurrently used by the Adult Education Board Centre.  
  
In 1984, Kim Keat Primary School closed. The remaining students in Kim Keat Primary School were transferred to Moulmein Primary School. The school building remained vacant for several years. Subsequently, the building was used as the first SCDF Division Headquarters. Since 2008, Curtin University Singapore has used the former site of Kim Keat Primary School.
