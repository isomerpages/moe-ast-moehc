<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Parry Avenue Girls’ School was established in the mid-to-late 1950s. It
was located at Parry Avenue, next to Parry Avenue Boys’ School and Parry
Avenue Government Chinese Middle School. Parry Avenue Girls’ School was
one of the first English-stream schools in the 1960s to offer Tamil alongside
Chinese and Malay as a second language.</p>
<p>The school was one of ten schools in Singapore to receive a Certificate
of Merit in the 1968 ‘Keep Singapore Clean’ campaign’s interschool cleanliness
competition. Organised by the Singapore Tourist Association (STA), this
competition featured 517 participating schools. The school’s track and
field team won many prizes and its choir was part of a 12-school choir
at the Singapore Festival of Choirs in 1980.</p>
<p>In 1981, Parry Avenue Girls’ School merged with neighbouring Parry Avenue
Boys’ School and Parry Avenue Government Chinese Middle School to form
Parry Primary School.</p>
