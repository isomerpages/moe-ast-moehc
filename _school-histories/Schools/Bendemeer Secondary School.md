#### **School History**
Prior to moving to its current location at 1 St Wilfred Road, Bendemeer Secondary School was located along busy Serangoon Road for over 20 years, on the land owned by Mr Hoo Ah Kay, better known as \`Whampoa’. Established in 1977, the school was officially declared open on 5 April 1979. With an average student population of 1,800, Bendemeer Secondary School was one of the largest secondary schools in Singapore in the 1980s. From 1980 to 1995, Bendemeer Secondary School was also a Pre-University Centre. In 1998, the school moved to its current premises at 1 St Wilfred Road, the former site of Whampoa Secondary School.

In 2015, Bendemeer Secondary School embarked on its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Making Health Science Alive through Authentic Problem-based Learning’, which helps students develop an appreciation of the concepts and principles relating to health science

In keeping with the school’s mission of one that serves the community, the Learning for Life Program (LLP) became a key feature of the school from 2015. The LLP seeks to provide a variety of rich learning opportunities for students to become co­creators of knowledge. As an education method, service learning provides students with the opportunity to gain character, develop a sense of ethics and modify their value system if need be. Students acquire and develop skills that endear them to becoming effective leaders as well as expand their career awareness. Through civic engagement, community partner collaboration and personal reflection, the LLP also prepares students for active citizenship.

In 2017, Bendemeer Secondary School celebrated its 40th anniversary with the launch of the school’s Heritage Gallery which encapsulated the various milestones that the school has throughout the years.

In 2019, the school was selected as one of 8 schools to pilot the 1:1 Computing Programme with ETD.
