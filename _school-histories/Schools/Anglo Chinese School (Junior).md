#### **School History**
Anglo-Chinese School (Junior) \[ACS(J)\] is one of the seven units in the ACS Family of Schools. The all-boys ACS was founded on 1 March 1886 by Bishop William Fitzjames Oldham in a shophouse at 70 Amoy Street. Adopting a bilingual approach to education, the boys learnt English in the morning and Chinese in the afternoon. Although the school had started with only 13 students, its high quality of education made it popular and well respected in the local community. In order to cater to the rapidly increasing student population, the school moved in 1887 to larger premises on Coleman Street.   
  
ACS functioned as a full school until 1928 when the lower-level classes were separated and the primary school established. With the continued growth of the school, there was a need for a second primary school, and thus ACS (J) was established at the Barker Road campus in January 1951. Curiously, both primary schools at that point shared the same name – ‘Junior School’ – until 1957 when the two schools assumed their identifying names. From the beginning, the school has focused on not only curricular but also extra-curricular activities – a common feature in all the ACS schools. For instance, the school has had students who later became national swimmers. Till today, rugby and swimming remain niche areas of the school. ACS (J) is proud to have contributed to the making of Singapore’s first Olympic gold medal in swimming.   
  
In 1985, ACS (J) moved to the Cairnhill campus and remained there until 2008. In 2009, the school moved to its present premises at 16 Winstedt Road.  
  
The pursuit of Academic excellence, Character development and Service based on Christian values still remains a cornerstone in the school’s vision, which aims to make ‘Every ACSian, a young gentleman of character, ready for the future, to lead and to serve’. This vision has the support of the Old Boys and parents. Together, they fuel an ACS spirit that bonds every ACSian together in a close-knit family.

#### **School Motto**
The Best Is Yet To Be

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/acsjunior1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The upper part of the crest shows a creature with a lion head, eagle wings and a dragon body with claws, representing the fact that the School was founded when Singapore was a British colony, by the American Methodist Mission, and during the Manchu dynasty in China.  
  
The lower part of the ACS Crest comprises a panel of blue and another of gold, representing the heavens and the earth. Superimposed on them are the letters ACS in red, signifying life bridging earth and heaven.  
  
The ACS Crest is shaped as a shield to uphold knightly values such as chivalry, honour, valour, loyalty and manliness. The letters 'ACS', besides being the initials of the school's name, also spell Academic achievements, Christian Character, and Sportsmanship and Service beyond self. The crest was designed in 1930 by the late Dr Yap Pheng Geck who was then a member of the staff.  
  
The school motto, The Best Is Yet To Be, which was later introduced by the late Mr. T.W. Hinch (Principal,1929- 1947), was incorporated into the crest.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

In days of yore from western shores<br>
Oldham dauntless hero came<br>
and planted a beacon of Truth and Light<br>
in this island of the Main.<br>
Here may it stand from year to year<br>
emblem of grand endeavour<br>
The regions round echo the sound<br>
of A.C.S. forever.

(Chorus)<br>
Sing A.C.S. forever more,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.
  
Our students hail from China's plains<br>
and the Land of Rising Sun.<br>
We have many sons from India's Strand<br>
and the Islands of the Main.<br>
Our hearts our hopes our aims are one.<br>
No discord e'er will sever.<br>
We'll stand together for the cause<br>
of A.C.S. forever.
  
(Chorus)<br>
Sing A.C.S. forever more,<br>
our A.C.S. forever.<br>
God save our land and heaven bless<br>
our A.C.S. forever.
