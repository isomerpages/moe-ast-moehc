#### **School History**
Junyuan Secondary School was established in January 1999 to serve the community of Tampines. The school began with 280 students and quickly grew to more than 1000 students. From the onset, the school's strategic focus was to cultivate the Champion Mindset of its students and staff so that they are empowered to Lead, Serve, and Excel. School programmes are crafted for students to practise and embody the school motto of Resolute, Righteous and Responsible. Students contributed to the community by organising key events such as the Youth Olympics Art Exhibition in 2010 and various social innovation challenges from 2009 to 2018. These platforms provided students with positive school experiences to exercise their leadership, hone their resilience and nurture a sense of personal accountability and gratitude.

In 2013, the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) integrated Food Science into the formal curriculum to build on students' learning in Food and Consumer Education classes. It held its first Junyuan MasterChef Challenge, a platform for Secondary One students to put their ALP and FCE skills and knowledge to the test. The school adapted the popular cooking reality TV show into a competition in which students collaborate to create hearty dishes using mystery ingredients. It has since evolved into a landmark experience that students look forward to as the finale event of the year.

The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Community Youth Leadership (CYL) contributes to its vision of preparing students to be Champions for the Community. The school's leadership program reinforces the belief that leadership is not positional, and that every student possesses the potential to lead. Student leaders are developed into concerned citizens and active contributors through a variety of structured leadership training, learning programs, and opportunities.

To provide an authentic experience for character building, the school launched its signature programme Camp Resilience for Secondary Two students in 2016. The camp, which includes orienteering, an obstacle race, and a cycling expedition develops students into citizens of character through teamwork and leadership.

Junyuan Secondary implemented Mixed Form Classes and Common Curriculum as part of its Full Subject Based Banding journey in 2023. Each Mixed Class connects students from various courses and provides opportunities for students to learn alongside peers with diverse interests and strengths. Students in Mixed Form Classes get to learn from, interact with, and bond with a diverse group of peers, which broadens their perspectives and enhances their school experiences.

#### **School Motto**
Resolute, Righteous, Responsible

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/junyuansec1.jpg">

The letters ‘J’ and ‘Y’ nestling on a double ‘S’ symbolise the development and growth of the individual child in school, within the context of the community at large and the nation. Junyuan (俊源) – meaning ‘the source of good things’ in Mandarin – is the place where students are taught to be persons of character and to discover, strive and pursue the truth and the ideals of education. It is where students are nurtured by a supportive school community to develop their potential as they challenge themselves to greater heights. Students are constantly reminded that they have a role to play in society. Whilst they are given opportunities to grow to be unique individuals, capable of independent thought and expression, they also have a duty to be responsible citizens of the nation and the world.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14pPUuXK6Z35kGl7OSGuyBBlLULjJ_0WA/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a> 

Junyuan a place we can turn to,<br>
a place that teaches right from wrong.<br>
It’s where we study, work and play,<br>
to be skilled in every way.<br>
It’s where we strive to be disciplined and strong.<br>
Junyuan is where we build our dreams on,<br>
where good things are bestowed on us.<br>
So in our future deeds and times,<br>
in its name we sound the chimes,<br>
let’s proclaim our heritage with a stirring chorus.

Chorus<br>
for Junyuan we shall raise our cry,<br>
and long shall our ensign fly;<br>
our alma mater we sing thy praise<br>
in your colours we set the trail ablaze.

Let us proclaim our watchwords to all<br>
we are resolute, righteous, responsible.<br>
Our motto we seek to uphold, to exemplify and show,<br>
Junyuan’s emblem we would hoist to show the world.

Chorus<br>
for Junyuan we shall raise our cry,<br>
and long shall our ensign fly;<br>
our alma mater we sing thy praise<br>
in your colours we set the trail ablaze.
