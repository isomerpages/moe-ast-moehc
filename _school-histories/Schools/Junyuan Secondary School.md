#### **School History**
Established in 1999, Junyuan Secondary School is a familiar landmark in Tampines. It started with a small cohort of 320 students; over the years, its population grew to more than 1,000 students. Every year, hundreds of Junyuanites graduate from the school.

Character building and the focus on nurturing champions for the community permeate the school’s curriculum, programmes and culture. In 2005, a journey to nurture the ‘champion mindset’ for students and staff was charted. This bore the school mission, which is to empower students and staff ‘to lead, to serve and to excel’.

The next stage of growth for Junyuan emphasised quality and excellence through innovation. In 2014, Junyuan Secondary launched its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Developing Application-based Learning through Food Science and Technology’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Cultivating Community Champions through Youth Leadership’. The following year, the school was recognised as a ‘best practice’ school for staff well-being and development, and attained the I-Class for the Business Excellence Award.

Recognising that the next stage of the school’s journey needed an itinerary for sustainable improvement, the school focused on developing staff to become both efficient and effective. For the students, iconic programmes – such as the Junyuan Masterchef Challenge, Sports Fest and community-focused Values-in-Action – were strengthened to provide them with positive school experiences so as to build leadership, resilience and a sense of personal accountability and gratitude.  Restorative practice was enhanced as a common language to build community relationships, and the introduction of the Student Leadership Challenge reinforced the school’s commitment to see a leader in each student. Even as Junyuanites are enabled to obtain the keys to open many doors in life, they will also learn to be champions for the community and become better persons for others.

#### **School Motto**
Resolute, Righteous, Responsible

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/junyuansec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The letters ‘J’ and ‘Y’ nestling on a double ‘S’ symbolise the development and growth of the individual child in school, within the context of the community at large and the nation. Junyuan (俊源) – meaning ‘the source of good things’ in Mandarin – is the place where students are taught to be persons of character and to discover, strive and pursue the truth and the ideals of education. It is where students are nurtured by a supportive school community to develop their potential as they challenge themselves to greater heights. Students are constantly reminded that they have a role to play in society. Whilst they are given opportunities to grow to be unique individuals, capable of independent thought and expression, they also have a duty to be responsible citizens of the nation and the world.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Junyuan a place we can turn to,<br>
a place that teaches right from wrong.<br>
It’s where we study, work and play,<br>
to be skilled in every way.<br>
It’s where we strive to be disciplined and strong.<br>
Junyuan is where we build our dreams on,<br>
where good things are bestowed on us.<br>
So in our future deeds and times,<br>
in its name we sound the chimes,<br>
let’s proclaim our heritage with a stirring chorus.

Chorus<br>
for Junyuan we shall raise our cry,<br>
and long shall our ensign fly;<br>
our alma mater we sing thy praise<br>
in your colours we set the trail ablaze.

Let us proclaim our watchwords to all<br>
we are resolute, righteous, responsible.<br>
Our motto we seek to uphold, to exemplify and show,<br>
Junyuan’s emblem we would hoist to show the world.

Chorus<br>
for Junyuan we shall raise our cry,<br>
and long shall our ensign fly;<br>
our alma mater we sing thy praise<br>
in your colours we set the trail ablaze.
