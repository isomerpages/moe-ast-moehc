#### **School History**
In 1993, Chong Boon Secondary School (CBSS) accepted its first batch of students, operating at Anderson Secondary School’s former building at 2 Ang Mo Kio Street 44. The school was established in 1994 and officially opened on 20 April 1996. The school's chinese name, 崇文中学, means a school that highly values education. It reflects the school’s love of knowledge and passion for learning.

Over the next 24 years, the school blossomed under the nurturing leadership of four principals and evolved into a ‘Garden of Growth’.

In 2000, the school embraced the vision, ‘A Thinking and Gracious Citizen’. In the same year, the school underwent PRIME upgrading. In 2004, the new school building was officially opened, in time for its 10th anniversary celebration.

In 2005, CBSS became the first school to establish a satellite partnership with Pathlight School, in a move to build an inclusive society. The partnership provides purposeful integration and sustained opportunities for students with different needs to interact with one another.

In 2006, the school adopted the enduring metaphor of ‘Chong Boon, Our Garden of Growth’ and a new school crest. The metaphor reflects the school’s efforts and initiatives in environmental education. In 2009, CBSS was the first school to be awarded niche status in environmental education for its exemplary green efforts. By 2015, the school had strengthened its niche and launched its Applied Learning Programme in sustainable technologies. The programme aimed to nurture students to become creative and critical thinkers through the learning of sustainable technologies.

In 2015, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in community and youth leadership. The LLP aimed to grow socially responsible, inclusive and active citizens who value and respect differences in people, and serve with humility and care. The LLP also advocated for environmentally sustainable living habits. 

A former government-aided and co-educational secondary school, CBSS was merged with Yio Chu Kang Secondary School in 2018, adopting the latter’s name. However, the merged school retained CBSS’s Chinese name to reflect the amalgamation of the strengths and heritage of both schools.

#### **School Motto**
Competence, Benevolence, Steadfastness

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/chongboonsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The roots branching out in five directions symbolise the school’s five core values: perseverance, respect, integrity, dedication to the school and nation, and excellence. The roots are the foundation of the tree; without them, the tree will not survive. Just like the roots, the core values are the school’s firm beliefs that are deeply rooted. With these values, the school will grow and flourish.

The circular shape symbolises a holistic education in which students are educated to be gracious all-rounders. The flow design of the horizon reflects the ease that students feel in embracing a holistic education.

The tree reaching towards the sky symbolises the students developing social and emotional competencies, and maximising their potential in whatever they do.

The birds flying in the sky represent the creative and entrepreneurial spirit of the school. They signify the students going beyond the school and curriculum to venture into uncharted territories in their pursuit of lifelong learning. With moral courage, confidence and resilience, they will fly the extra mile to serve the nation.
