#### **School History**
Established in 1952, Paya Lebar School was located in an one story building at Lorong Bengkok, off Paya Lebar Road.&nbsp;When the school first started, there were only seven classes. In 1956, it grew to having two full sessions.&nbsp;  
  
In 1984, Paya Lebar School closed and its remaining students were provided alternative places in nearby primary schools. From 1984 to 2017, the former site of Paya Lebar School was taken over by neighbouring Macpherson Secondary School. In 2017, Macpherson Secondary School merged with Broadrick Secondary School and the merged school occupied the premises of the latter.&nbsp;  
  
The building of Macpherson Secondary School was subsequently demolished and the former site of Paya Lebar School has remained vacant since then.&nbsp;
