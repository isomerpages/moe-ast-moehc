#### **School History**
St Gabriel’s School was established on 1 June 1953 with 212 students in five classes from Primary One to Standard Two. The students were taught by eight teachers including the acting director of the school, Reverend Brother Louis Gonzaga.

Reverend Brother Elzear became the first director of the school on 3 May 1954. In 1958, the enrolment increased to 970, with 640 students in the morning session and 330 students in the afternoon session. In the same year, the school became a full school with the first Secondary Four class. In 1969, St Gabriel’s split into primary and secondary schools. The primary school moved into new premises at 2 Highland Road with an enrolment of 1,350 boys. The secondary school became single-session, located on Upper Serangoon Road.

In 1984, Mr John Teo became the school’s first lay principal, ending a line of clerics who have led the school honourably. In 1990, the school had its first and only female principal, Mrs Ng Peng Hock. With the increasing enrolment, the school soon needed larger premises. A piece of land at Serangoon Avenue 1 was subsequently identified for the location of the new campus. The school moved into the new building at the end of 1992. 

St Gabriel’s celebrated its golden jubilee in 2003. The year also marked a physical change in the school: A big portion of the Tien (天) building was demolished, and the school moved into a new wing.

#### **School Motto**
Labor Omnia Vincit<br>
Latin for ‘Labour Conquers All Things’<br>
Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/stgabrielsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The centrepiece of the school crest is the coat of arms, which has four quadrants. The top-left quadrant has the letters ‘A.M.’, which stands for ‘Ave Maria’, with a lily flower. This was the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the beginning of the ‘Hail Mary’ prayer. According to St Louis Marie de Montfort, wisdom can be attained through living a life of gentleness and authenticity, modelled after Mary the mother of God.

The bottom-right quadrant has the letters ‘D+S’ with a cross. ‘D.S.’ is the abbreviation for ‘Dieu Seul’, which is French for ‘God Alone’. ‘God Alone’ is the all-motivating force in the life of St Louis Marie de Montfort. To him, God is the centre of his life, and in everything he does, God is foremost for him. For St Louis Marie de Montfort, all knowledge comes to nothing if one does not know God. Thus to know all things but not to know God is to know nothing at all.

The top-right quadrant features a sailboat at sea. It symbolises the struggle and mortification in life. Much like the ship at sea, one emerges the better if he or she is able to weather through the storms of life. No problem is too great to overcome and it is in perseverance and resilience that one shall be able to face the difficulties in life.

In the bottom-left quadrant are the star and the man in the boat. This symbolises the Star of the Sea, which seamen use for navigation in the vast ocean. If one is focused on the essential values of life, he or she can reach the ultimate destiny in life. The Star of the Sea is the guiding light in life.

The crest is adorned with green olive branches, which is derived from Ancient Greece, symbolising peace and prosperity. It is one’s duty to promote lasting peace in the world. Coupled with peace is prosperity, which connotes not only the generation of wealth but also the integral development of human society.

At the bottom of the crest is the Latin motto, ‘Labor Omnia Vincit’.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

In white and blue, boys full of mirth and life<br>
From early morn, we flood the green playground<br>
In every hall, soon starts the daily strife<br>
Of school routine, lessons and work all round<br>
With spirits bright, our will we’ll gladly bracing<br>
From teachers kind we learn what’s good and right<br>
We thus do hope to attain with God’s blessing<br>
Virtue and Truth, Virtue and Truth<br>
Of life’s true beacon light

Saint Gabriel’s School Dear<br>
Here willing hearts behold<br>
When duty’s call rings clear<br>
‘Mid sorrows as through joys<br>
For Singapore and God<br>
For justice to uphold<br>
Let us live and thus prove<br>
Saint Gabriel’s boys
