#### **School History**
Founded in 1951, Stamford Girls' School was established as a single session school with six teachers and three classes located at 155 Waterloo Street. The school catered to the children living at Middle Road, Waterloo Street, Queen Street and Selegie Road areas, addressing the urgent need for education in the post-war years.  
  
The name ‘Stamford Girls’ School’ was chosen by then principal of Raffles Girls’ School, Miss M. Hadley. It was envisioned at that time for Stamford Girls' School to be sister school of Raffles Girls’ School though the plan did not realise. 

During the Japanese Occupation, the building of Stamford Girls' School housed the First National People's School. Lessons took place in the gymnasium as Gan Eng Seng School took over the main school building after WWII from 1947 to 1951.

By March 1951, Gan Eng Seng School moved to their new premises in Anson Road. Stamford Girls' School began to occupy the building. At the same time, the then Education Department transferred three classes from Raffles Girls’ School to Stamford Girls' School as the former had exceeded its student enrolment capacity. A year later, the Raffles Girls’ Afternoon School also moved from Raffles Girls’ School and shared the building with Stamford Girls’ School. Stamford Girls’ School was also known as ‘Stamford Girls' Afternoon School’.  
  
In 1955, Stamford Girls’ School moved to the new building located at the junction of Waterloo Street and Middle Road, becoming a full school with two sessions. By then, Stamford Girls’ School was second government girls’ school in Singapore. Over the years, the school was known for its Drama and Music with active student participation in school choir and dance groups as well as sporting achievements in netball and athletics events.

In 1984, Stamford Girls’ School merged with Waterloo Primary School to form Stamford Primary School. The merged co-ed school was named Stamford Primary School, taking its name from Stamford Girls’ School, while it retained Waterloo Primary School’s crest. Two years later, Stamford Primary School was relocated to 1 Victoria Lane. Students from Selegie Primary School also joined Stamford Primary School. In 1988, Stamford Primary School was officially open.  
  
Since then, the Stamford Arts Centre has been housed in the former Stamford Girls' School building at Waterloo Street.

#### **School Song**
School of our youth we sing,<br>
Our praises loud and clear.<br>
Loud shall our voices ring<br>
In thanks to thee so dear,<br>
Help us to grow,<br>
In body, mind and spirit<br>
Stamford Girls’ School.

For knowledge, strength and truth<br>
For joy of friends so dear,<br>
Teachers to help us in our youth<br>
Safe from all fear.<br>
And through the year<br>
Will strive our best and serve the rest<br>
Stamford Girls’ School.
