#### **School History**
Established in 1952, Bartley Secondary School was the first co-educational secondary school in Singapore. In 1956, Bartley Secondary School became a full-fledged all-boys school in the secondary section. In the same year, its pre-university section started with both male and female students. In 1995, the school relocated to new premises at 10 Jalan Bunga Rampai. In the same year, female students were admitted into Secondary One and the school became a co-educational school again. In 1996, pre-university classes were phased out.

In 2012, Bartley Secondary School celebrated its 60th anniversary. In 2015, Bartley Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in chemical and applied sciences (fragrance), and the Learning for Life Programme in community youth leadership.

In 2016, Bartley Secondary School merged with First Toa Payoh Secondary School and retained its name. The merged school has since operated from the premises at 10 Jalan Bunga Rampai.

#### **School Motto**
_Facta Non Verba_

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bartleysec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The book at the top underscores the importance of education. The yellow lion symbolises strength and steadfastness. The tower beneath the lion is a reminder of the importance of vigilance. The white stripes represent honesty in the search for knowledge and in oneself. The red portions of the crest represent friendship, love, loyalty and brotherhood, which are attributes of Bartleyans.

The school motto ‘Facta Non Verba’ refers to a belief in deeds and not just words.

#### **School Song**

Bartley school of Singapore<br>
Up and coming to the fore,<br>
Let us hail our alma mater ever more.<br>
Strong and steadfast we will be,<br>
Forge a strong community,<br>
With the links of friendship,<br>
Love and loyalty
  
Chorus:<br>
Let’s cry “Facta Non Verba”<br>
And proclaim it near and far,<br>
Whether it be work or play<br>
We’ll go on from day to day,<br>
And be well-prepared<br>
To stand up to the fray
  
Majulah Singapura<br>
Majulah Singapura<br>
That’s the cheer that links<br>
Our people near and far.<br>
Singapore will always be,<br>
Growing with prosperity,<br>
With the spirit that has<br>
Made us strong and free.<br>
  
Chorus:<br>
Let’s cry “Facta Non Verba”<br>
And proclaim it near and far,<br>
Whether it be work or play<br>
We’ll go on from day to day,<br>
And be well-prepared<br>
To stand up to the fray
