#### **School History**
Si Ling Secondary School (SLSS) was the first secondary school to be established in the Woodlands housing estate in 1980. It was also the first secondary school in Woodlands to offer both English and Chinese as the mediums of instruction. In 1985, the school became a fully English-medium school.

In the early 1990s the school developed its own model of nurturing students known as ‘The Nurture of a Silian’. This scheme aimed to promote care, concern, innovation and creativity among the students. During this period, SLSS was known as a ‘second-chance school’: Students who came to SLSS for a second chance were taken in.

In 2007, the school was designated by the Ministry of Education as one of the three Normal Technical Mark II schools in Singapore, where Institute of Technical Education (ITE) lecturers were seconded to teach applied learning subjects for students in the Normal Technical stream to better prepare them for the courses at ITE.

These efforts led to the consolidation of its flagship programmes and their respective frameworks. The programme, Res Adventura_,_&nbsp;was designed to promote leadership, teamwork, self-confidence, love for the outdoors and a spirit of adventure. It would evolve to become the school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘VALOUR’ (Values and Character-building through Outdoor Curriculum).

In the later years, as most of the students were kinesthetic learners and aesthetically inclined, SilcARTS – Cornucopia of the Arts Framework, was formed, targeted at the aesthetic development of the students. From 2010 to 2015, the school staged a musical every year.

On 1 January 2017, Si Ling Secondary School merged with Marsiling Secondary School. The merged school took on the latter’s name while adopting Si Ling’s Chinese name.
