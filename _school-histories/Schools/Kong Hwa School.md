#### **School History**
Kong Hwa School was established by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan in 1953 on Guillemard Road. The land was donated by Mr Tan Lark Sye and part of the funds was donated by Mr Lee Kong Chian. In 1957, Kong Hwa School became government-aided. In 1992, the school was awarded the Special Assistance Plan status in recognition of its continued good performance at PSLE and its strong emphasis on the learning of Chinese and its culture. Kong Hwa School underwent two upgrading: the first one was from 1992 to 1997 and the second one was from 2010 to mid-2012.

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

光华，光华<br>
我亲爱的学校<br>
校舍堂皇，校旗飘飘<br>
老师循循善诱，认真教导<br>
同学天真活泼，心灵手巧<br>
齐努力，课室里面人人用手脑<br>
冲上前，运动场上个个逞英豪<br>
今天是蹦蹦跳跳的小学生<br>
明天要把国家社会建设好
