#### **School History**
Established in 1965, Hua Yi Primary School was located at Margaret Drive.  
  
The school band participated in many community functions and school performances. It was even featured on the back of the old fifty-dollar Singapore note.  
  
In 1991, Hua Yi Primary School merged with Queenstown Primary School. The building of Hua Yi Primary School was subsequently used as a Ministry of Education (MOE) examination centre. The former site of the school has remained vacant since 2009.
