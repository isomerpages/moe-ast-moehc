We are pupils of North View Primary<br>
Where we learn to love and share.<br>
Let’s show our valour and nobility<br>
for nation and school we care.

Let us rise and shine like the morning star<br>
Noble and brave young as we are<br>
Pure and tender with hearts of love<br>
Citizens of tomorrow ready to serve.

We will persevere and do our best<br>
As we strive to achieve success.<br>
Together prove our ability<br>
As we study diligently.
