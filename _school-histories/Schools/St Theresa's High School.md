#### **School History**
Established in 1935, St. Theresa’s High School was initially named St. Theresa's Sino English Primary School. The school was housed in a rented bungalow at Kampong Bahru Road. The school’s emphasis was on providing Chinese vernacular education to its students.  
  
During the Japanese Occupation, the school served as a refugee centre.  
  
After World War II, a new school building was built next to the Church of St. Theresa. In 1965, the school accepted secondary school students. Hence, the school was renamed St. Theresa's Sino English School.  
  
The school later became known as St. Theresa's High School. In 1998, St. Theresa’s High School closed.
