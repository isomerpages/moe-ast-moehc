#### **School History**
Nan Chiau Primary School was established in March 1947 as the primary section of Nan Chiau Girls’ High School, located at Kim Yan Road. It was one of the six Chinese-medium schools run by Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan. In 1965, Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan spent $2 million rebuilding Nan Chiau Girl’s High School. The new premises were officially opened on 8 March 1969.

In 1979, Nan Chiau High began functioning as a full school, with both primary and secondary sections sharing the same premises. In 1980, the school became an English-medium school. In 1984, Nan Chiau Girls’ High became co-educational and was renamed Nan Chiau High School.

In 2001, Nan Chiau Primary School separated from Nan Chiau High School and was relocated to Anchorvale Link. In 2010, Nan Chiau Primary School was identified as the North Zone Centre of Excellence in Information and Communications Technology. The school prides itself on using appropriate technology to support students’ learning, and was recognised as a ‘Future School’ in 2011.

Nan Chiau Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Project-based Learning. Technology is an integral part of school life for staff and students, and planning lessons with technological components is second nature to teachers.

\- Mr Tan Chun Meng (2008–2014)<br>

The crest is represented by three interlocking rings that symbolise the moral, physical and intellectual development of the students. These are intrinsic to the quest for excellence in education. The red rings depict a persevering spirit to pursue a bright and promising future, as represented by the golden background.
