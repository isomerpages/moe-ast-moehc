#### **School History**
Established in 1950, Duchess School was located along Duchess Avenue and was initially known as Duchess Road School. Duchess School was first housed in a single-storey building. On 18 September 1963, a new four-storey block within the same campus was built for the school. This new block was officially declared open by Mr Mohd. Ariff bin Suradi, Member of Legislative Assembly for Ulu Pandan.  
  
In December 1984, Duchess School closed down. Many of its students subsequently joined Farrer Primary School. The school building was later demolished and used for residential housing estates.
