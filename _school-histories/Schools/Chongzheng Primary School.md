#### **School History**
Chongzheng Primary School welcomed its first batch of 994 students, 42 teachers and other staff on 2 January 1985. Chongzheng means ‘steadfast and respectable’ in Mandarin. The origins of the present Chongzheng Primary School, which is the hanyu pinyin name of the former Chong Cheng School, can be traced to an old-style Chinese private school that was set up in 1905. The school moved to various locations in the vicinity of Beach Road until 1938 when a new building on Aliwal Road was completed. The building accommodated the students of Chong Cheng School and its sister school, Chong Pun.

The school was officially opened on 10 April 1987. In April 2002, Chongzheng moved into the newly constructed building after the completion of PRIME.

As a testament to its continued efforts in delivering quality holistic education, it was recognised with the School Distinction Award and four Best Practices Awards (Teaching and Learning; Character and Citizenship Education; Student All-Round Development; and Staff Well-Being and Development).   

Throughout the years, Chongzheng has organised many events to make the educational journey of its students more enriching and memorable. In 2009, Chongzheng celebrated its 25th anniversary by putting up its first musical, _Feel the Joy_. Its presence in the community is further felt when it organised FUNival, a fundraising event, in 2012. This event was held in collaboration with its School Advisory Committee and Unity Primary School. In 2014, it celebrated its 30th anniversary with the theme ‘Celebrating Ties, Building Bonds’. During this special event, it recognised the efforts of its various partners – parents, community and private organisations. The following year, it celebrated SG50 with the community by presenting the musical, _All As One,_ and entering the Singapore Book of Records for the longest ‘Yeh-Yeh’.
