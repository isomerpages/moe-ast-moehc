#### **School History**
On 1 August 1879, Father Jose Pedro Santa Anna de Cunha decided to start a school for the children of his poor parishioners. The school, a small house on Middle Road, was called St. Anna’s School. The first teachers were Misses C.M.E. Buccanan, Margaret Dias and Mary Ann Rugguly.

In 1881, Father Nicholas Pinto, the new director of the school, decided to build a larger building within the church compound along Middle Road. On 23 February 1886, the new building was named ‘St Anthony’s Boys’ and Girls’ School’, which educated girls and boys together.

In November 1893, the school became two separate schools: St. Anthony’s Boys’ and St. Anthony’s Girls’ schools. A new beginning for the girls’ school came about on 11 December 1894: The first four Canossian sisters – Mother Theresa Rossi, Mother Justina Sequeirs, Mother Matilda Rodrigues and Mother Harietta Rossini – arrived in Singapore to take over the girls’ school. The school grew and, with aid from the Portuguese Mission and subsidies from the government and private sectors, a new wing was added in 1899.

In 1928, a new building comprising 12 spacious rooms was added. There were further extensions made at the premises. In 1953, an imposing five-storey edifice replaced the old part of the convent. Finally, in 1971, administration of the primary and secondary schools was separated and the schools were named St. Anthony’s Convent Primary School and St. Anthony’s Convent Secondary School. In 1995, the schools moved from Middle Road to new premises at Bedok North Avenue 4. At the same time, the schools were renamed as St. Anthony’s Canossian Primary and St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary, respectively.

In December 2010, the school moved to a holding site as its current premises underwent PRIME upgrading from 2011 to 2012. The school returned to its original location at 1602 Bedok North Avenue 4 at the end of 2012, and started 2013 in the upgraded premises.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/stanthonycanossianpri1.png">

The school badge is meant for all Canossian Schools. On a dark-blue background there shines a four-pointed star with rays cast onto a book symbolising the Star of Wisdom Shining on Knowledge. The star is a symbol of lofty ideas stirring a person to great and noble deeds. The four points of the star represent four basic social virtues: truth, justice, love and freedom.

<br clear="left">

Truth:&nbsp;sincerity in words and deeds, simplicity and straightforwardness.  
Justice: honesty, fairness, respect for the right of others.  
Love:&nbsp;readiness to help and share with others.  
Freedom: mutual tolerance and consideration for the principles of others.

The Crown above the crest symbolises the supremacy of God over all and All for the Glory of God.

On the crest of the motto for all Canossian schools: VIA VERITAS VITA<br>
VIA – The Way, VERITAS – The Truth,&nbsp; VITA – The Life

United in common endeavour<br>
At work and play, life's lessons we learn<br>
Our youthful hearts are filled with ardour<br>
Truth and wisdom we yearn

Chorus<br>
Courageously with heads held high<br>
We march ever on through life<br>
Schooled in your spirit Canossa<br>
For virtue, true nobility we strive<br>
Schooled in your spirit Canossa<br>
For true virtue we strive

Our alma mater, our guardian, our guide<br>
Prepare our spirits for duty's call<br>
Our country to serve with virtuous might<br>
We stand for truth and for right
