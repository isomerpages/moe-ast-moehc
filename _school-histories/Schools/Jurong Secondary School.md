#### **School History**
Jurong Secondary School (JSS) was founded in 1963 at the request of community leaders to founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew, when he made his first visit to Jurong. Originally named Jurong Integrated Secondary School, the school offered the English and Chinese courses. JSS began with five teachers and about 100 students.

On 2 November 1974, JSS relocated to its current premises on Yuan Ching Road. When demand for post-secondary education increased, it was designated as a Pre-University Centre in 1981, offering a three-year pre-university course. The course ceased in 1991.

In 2006, JSS was awarded niche status in basketball in recognition of its strong tradition in sporting excellence. Between 2007 and 2012, it also received accolades from the Ministry of Education for its quality teaching and learning programme as well as commitment to continuous innovation. In 2007, JSS was selected as one of the six pioneer schools in the FutureSchools@Singapore project.

During the school’s 50th anniversary, it launched Project \[Com\]Passion, which reaffirmed the school’s commitment to nurture students who would empathise with the needs of the community. Believing in the importance of supporting student aspirations regardless of their entry points, the school applied successfully to be one of the 12 secondary schools to pilot the Flexibility in Subject Offering at Higher Level initiative by the Ministry of Education in 2014.

In 2015, the Inspiring Student Passion in Recreational Endeavour (inSPire) Programme and Award was introduced. This was done to broaden the scope and extend the reach of the School Advisory Committee-sponsored Sports, Aesthetics, Innovation and Leadership Development (SAIL) Award, which was launched in 2008. Similar to SAIL, inSPire encourages student pursuits in different areas of interest and talent, while providing an avenue for the school and community to benefit from their contributions. Modules aligned to emerging industry trends were introduced.

In 2018, the school celebrated its 55th anniversary. Guided by the theme, ‘Jurong Sec Celebrates 55 Years of Nurturing and Giving’ (裕人裕心, 予区予群), it raised $61,680 for the Taman Jurong Community Development and Welfare Fund through a fundraising carnival. With support from the Taman Jurong Citizens’ Consultative and Residents’ Committees, the JSS-Taman Jurong Elderly Befriender Programme was launched, supporting the elderly to age gracefully and with dignity.
