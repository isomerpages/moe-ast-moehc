#### **School Song**
Knowledge lights my way<br>
As I learn and play from day to day<br>
And to build in me<br>
Obedience to authority in school and country

May Primary is our pride<br>
You'll guide us with your burning light<br>
Through our teachers we will be<br>
Productive to society

Knowledge lights my way<br>
As I learn and play from day to day<br>
And to build in me<br>
Obedience to authority in school and country
