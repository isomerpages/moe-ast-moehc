#### **School History**
Established in 1964, Commonwealth Secondary School started as Tanglin Integrated Vocational Secondary School and was one of the earliest schools to cater to children living in Queenstown. The school became known as Tanglin Secondary School in 1969, and was renamed Commonwealth Secondary School in 1972 to commemorate the first meeting of the Commonwealth heads of government, which was held in Singapore the year before.

In 1989, Commonwealth Secondary School relocated to Jurong East Avenue 1. The school was accorded autonomous status in 1995, in recognition of its progress and high quality of education. It was also during this period that the school built its strength in the performing arts and fine arts with the establishment of an art gallery. In 1996, the school relocated to a new campus on Jurong East Street 21.

By the 2000s, the school had established a niche in environmental education and the performing arts. In 2006, the school moved to its present premises at 698 West Coast Road. In 2008, the school was recognised as a Centre of Excellence for Environmental Education. Today, the school continues to nurture Commonwealthians to contribute to a greener world.

The school celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014. Around the same time, it underwent a pivotal transformation with the introduction of design thinking and maker education into its curriculum. Besides being used as an innovation tool for students to sharpen their creativity, design thinking was also used to improve school infrastructure and reinvent practices in the school, from teaching and learning processes to administrative procedures. In 2016, the school was recognised as a Centre of Excellence for Design and Innovation.

The transformations since 1964 has enabled the school to provide students with opportunities in distinct areas such as innovation, environmental education and the performing arts.

The gold of the flame represents faith and fruitfulness, while also forming the acronyms ‘CSS’ as well as ‘CWSS’. The blue of the logo represents infinite resourcefulness.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Chorus:<br>
Commonwealth Secondary School<br>
To you we pledge our total loyalty<br>
Neither colour nor creed shall affect<br>
The total unity we pledge to you

Your flag and principles we’ll cherish<br>
Even if we have in the course to perish<br>
The crescent and stars five shall guide<br>
The flame of solidarity in which we pride

To serve will be our very aim<br>
No influence will our zeal maim<br>
The purity of thought and deed we’ll nurture<br>
Thus we will attain stature
