#### **School History**
Christ Church School started in 1953 as a private school on Dorset Road, run by the Anglican Diocese. However, due to declining enrolment in 1972, Christ Church and the Anglican Diocese decided to convert the school into a government grant-in-aid school. The following year, Christ Church School became a fully government-aided school with eight Secondary One classes and was renamed Christ Church Secondary School (CHR).

On 15 June 1985, CHR moved to Tyrwhitt Road, taking over the old premises of Victoria School. Through hard work and determination, the school pushed ahead to provide value-added education to its students, achieving academic awards as well as improving its standing as a school that believes in holistic education driven by students’ needs, talents and abilities.

In December 2001, an entirely new campus in Woodlands, equipped with the latest technology for teaching and learning, was designated for the relocation of CHR. This led to greater aspirations for the school community. Holding fast to its belief that every person has worth and that his/her development can be nurtured to the optimum, CHR continues to refine its curriculum to develop well-rounded students who are confident to face the challenges of an ever-changing society.

In 2015, CHR began its Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in outdoor education, which focuses on developing students’ social-emotional competencies through outdoor adventure activities. The LLP is designed to allow CHRians to be challenged by choice according to their abilities as they learn to collaborate with each other to reach their goals.

In 2016, CHR was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in health science and technology. In close partnership with Woodlands Health Campus, the ALP aims to provide learning experiences that would interest students in learning science and coding and develop positive learning dispositions so that students can show better appreciation of real-world challenges in healthcare.

In January 2020, the Woodlands South MRT station was officially opened, opening doors to opportunities for the staff and students of CHR.&nbsp;

Today, CHR is proud to develop students into purposeful leaders who have the drive to excel, are thoughtful contributors and are active leaders.

#### **School Motto**
**Pray and Work**

_“For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God.”_

_– Colossians 1:9–10 (KJV)_

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/christchurchsec1.jpg">

At the heart of the crest, the flaming torch symbolises the commitment of CHR to lifelong learning. Through the journey of life and learning, students grow in character and in their God-given talents. The cross represents the school giving glory to God who has enabled its achievements, with Christ at the centre of its endeavours.

The colour yellow represents the light of God shining through as one serves the needs of people. Through leadership and possessing the right values and attitudes, CHR works to build a bright and glorious future. The colour red represents the school’s passion and determination to do its utmost for the highest. The colour green represents one’s life and spirit being continually renewed, and the eternal gratitude and thanksgiving to God for his abundance blessings showered on the school. The colour white represents one’s determination to never lose the purity of thought, word and deed. It shows forth through one’s earnestness and sincerity as one perseveres to grow, praying as one works.
#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QCTAyYzGl6_gHaPYUkq-6VZgmAB4rIGr/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a>

**To God be the Glory**<br>
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,<br>
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br>
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,<br>
And opened the life gate that all may go in.

Refrain:<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,<br>
Let the earth hear His voice!<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,<br>
Let the people rejoice!<br>
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,<br>
To every believer the promise of God;<br>
The vilest offender who truly believes,<br>
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,<br>
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;<br>
But purer, and higher, and greater will be,<br>
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
