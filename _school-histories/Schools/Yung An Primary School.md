#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>

Yung An Primary proudly stands<br>
Amidst industrial Jurong<br>
It’s here that we’re led by guiding hands<br>
It’s here that we’ll learn the right from wrong.

**Chorus:**<br>
Boys and girls of Yung An<br>
We will turn back never<br>
Boys and girls of Yung An<br>
Progress ours forever.

Knowledge strive we daily to gain<br>
To show our best in work and play<br>
May Yung An’s glory never wane<br>
May Yung An’s flag high with honour stay.
