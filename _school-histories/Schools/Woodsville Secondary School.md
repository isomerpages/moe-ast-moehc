Let us strive with heart and song<br>
For the school, our love, our second home<br>
Let us strive with words and deeds<br>
For the school a name to carve where we roam.

In years to come with love and pride<br>
Weâ€™ll recall the school we are so fond<br>
For Woodsville our best endeavour<br>
Woodsville our Alma Mater<br>
Be remembered forever and long.
