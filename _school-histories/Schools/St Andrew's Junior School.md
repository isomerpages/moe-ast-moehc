#### **School History**
St. Andrew’s School was founded on 8 September 1862. It was then located at Chin Chew Street. The following year, on 10 September 1863, the school moved to Upper Hokkien Street because it needed a better building and more space for the growing school population. Later, the continually expanding school moved yet again to Victoria Street. In the 1870s, the British government gave the school a four-acre plot of land on the then Government Hill (present-day Fort Canning) with a frontage on Stamford Road. Here, the Chapel was constructed in 1875; later that year, the school shifted to the Stamford Road site. In 1940, the school moved to a new two-storey building with a sprawling campus in Woodsville.

St. Andrew’s School was the first school to reopen after the war. As the enrolment grew, there was a pressing need for more classrooms. Another floor was added in 1952. That year, the Lim Teck Kin Tower was also added to the school premises.

St. Andrew's Junior School relocated to Potong Pasir in 1996. It was officially opened on 6 September 1997. The concept of St. Andrew’s Village (SAV) was soon mooted in 1999: All three institutions – (St. Andrew’s Junior College, St. Andrew’s Secondary School and St. Andrew’s Junior School) – were to come under one roof as ‘One Family Unbroken’ (as sung in the school hymn). SAV was officially opened on 26 August 2006.

To celebrate its 150th anniversary, the school gathered over 500 participants for an envisioning exercise in 2012. Participants included the school’s board of governors, alumni, staff, students, parents and other stakeholders.

After months of strategic dialogue, the new and shared school vision, mission and values for St. Andrew’s Village were formalised.
