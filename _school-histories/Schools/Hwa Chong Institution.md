#### **School History**
Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) has a rich history of over 100 years. The independent school is the culmination of the watershed merger of The Chinese High School (TCHS) and Hwa Chong Junior College (HCJC) in 2005.

TCHS was founded by Mr Tan Kah Kee in 1919 to cater to the needs of primary school leavers of the Chinese community in the region. It became the first Chinese-language secondary school in Southeast Asia. Entering Singapore’s post-independence era, TCHS was designated by the Ministry of Education (MOE) as one of the nine Special Assistance Plan schools in 1979, before turning independent in 1987.

HCJC was set up in 1974 as the first government-aided junior college. It offered courses in both English and Chinese before the national restructuring of the curriculum in 1982. HCJC was one of the first junior colleges to offer the Humanities Programme (1980), the MOE Language Elective Programme (Chinese) (1990) and the Bicultural Studies Programme (2005). In 2004, HCJC became the first independent college.

As it did not have a permanent home, HCJC was compelled to move a total of seven times in its history. Being sojourners on various borrowed premises, the early generations were confronted with innumerable challenges. Yet, the college went from strength to strength, quickly earning a reputation as an institution with a distinctive and strong school spirit.

Today, the former TCHS and HCJC make up the high school and college sections of HCI respectively. Offering the six-year Integrated Programme, the institution has developed a seamless and broad-based curriculum that aims to develop leaders holistically for the nation. In maintaining its tradition of excellence and recognising diverse developmental pathways, the institution has continued to offer MOE specialised programmes, in addition to the Art Elective Programme, the school-based Gifted Education, and the Science and Math Talent Programme.

The Hwa Chong experience is not just about academic excellence. All students undergo a sustained leadership and character education programme that emphasises active citizenry and the importance of contributing to the community. The many local and global service-learning projects spearheaded by Hwa Chong students bear testament to this enduring culture of service.

Today, many Hwa Chong alumni can be found contributing to the nation in diverse fields – from academia, entrepreneurship, public service to philanthropy.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/hwachonginstitution1.jpg">

The school logo is a highly stylised flaming torch that symbolises not only a burning passion for knowledge and drive for excellence, but also a deep respect for progress and tradition. The logo is rendered in the school colour, red, in keeping with Chinese notions of symbolism, depicting life, vitality and strength. It takes its inspiration from the Chinese character ‘华’ (meaning ‘Chinese’), which represents the school’s name and origin (华中). The logo also reflects a passion for the school’s rich cultural heritage, and its mission of nurturing bicultural leaders for the nation.

今日的校徽是由旧校徽演变而成的，其设计巧妙地结合火炬的图形与艺术化的“華”字，蕴含了华中建校的宗旨与校名的联系，以及推行双语双文化的教育使命与弘扬中华文化之丰富意涵。

海天寥廓 云树苍茏 中有我华中<br>
礼门义路 时雨春风 吾侪托帡幪<br>
猗与华中 南方之强 我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆

人生茫茫 学海洋洋 吾侪当自强<br>
朝乾夕惕 日就月将 莫负好时光<br>
猗与华中 南方之强 我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆

迨予庶士 笃实辉光 斐然已成章<br>
膂力方刚 经营四方 前途浩且长<br>
猗与华中 南方之强 我中华之光<br>
雄立狮岛 式是炎荒 万世其无疆

As part of our glorious land<br>
Sharing her spreading fame<br>
Hwa Chong will firmly stand<br>
Always to maintain her name

Multi-racial we study together<br>
For knowledge we wish to attain<br>
Many races we shall gather<br>
Each day to achieve its aim

We shall strive with verve<br>
For health in body and mind<br>
We'll learn to lead and yet to serve<br>
In character ruggedly fine

May Hwa Chong shine forever<br>
Her name big and strong<br>
One and all let's stand by her<br>
That she may live on and on
