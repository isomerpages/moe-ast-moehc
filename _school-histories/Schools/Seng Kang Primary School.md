#### **School History**
On 3 January 1997, Seng Kang Primary School (SKPS) was established as the first school in Sengkang. As the school building was still under construction, SKPS began operations at the premises of the former Hai Seng Girls’ High along Upper Serangoon Road. The school had 327 students in 10 classes and 23 staff members. The belief, ‘Everyone is Special, Everyone can Learn, Everyone can Serve’, guided the school. On 12 December 1997, the school moved to its current location at 21 Compassvale Walk.

The 1.8-hectare new campus comprised an administrative block and two four-storey teaching/classroom blocks. The school attained numerous achievements in academic and co-curricular programmes and became known for its character development programmes. 

At the 2006 Ministry of Education ExCEL Fest, the school was invited to share its Daily Physical Education Programme. The school persevered towards bringing out the best in every child. Programmes focused on strengthening the ‘heart ware’ and rootedness of the students to Singapore. In the pursuit of excellence, the school truly became ‘A Community of Happy Learners’. In 2011, the school underwent PRIME and PERI upgrading. By 2013, the enhanced campus had new buildings with bigger, well-equipped classrooms, an indoor sports hall, science labs and interactive learning spaces that made the environment the ‘third teacher’. In 2014, the school was recognised for two distinctive programmes: ‘Enhanced Spoken English Programme’, which became the Applied Learning Programme; and ‘Developing Values and Leadership through Sports Education’, which became the Learning for Life Programme. SKPS’s programmes and facilities played an important part in transforming the school into ‘A Vibrant Community of World-Ready Learners’. As the school moved into its 20th year in 2017, the school embarked on the next lap of the school’s journey with the mission, ‘Nurturing self-directed learners with inquiring minds, anchored on moral values to lead, care and serve’. 

The focus is to enable every Seng Kang Primary student to be ‘an Inventive Thinker, a Confident Leader and a Gracious Citizen’ anchored in the school values of graciousness, integrity, confidence and resilience, while holding on to the belief that ‘Everyone is Special, Everyone can Learn, Everyone can Serve’. SKPS celebrated its 25 years of school founding in 2022 with the theme of ‘Appreciate, Aspire, Achieve’. It was a significant milestone for the school as we braved through the challenges of covid-19 period and emerge stronger. 

Amid this joyous celebration, SKLites contributed our part for the community and participated in a ’25 km Run for Charity’ to raise funds for the Children’s Charities Association of Singapore. In 2022, the school also welcomed our first visit by Minister of Education, Mr Chan Chun Seng. Minister Chan inaugurated the school’s newly-opened MakerSpace which showcased the various innovative projects of our students.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/sengkangpri1.jpg">

The school crest has a diamond shape, which symbolises that every student is a gem to be treasured and nurtured. The colour white symbolises purity. The circle enclosing the letters ‘SK’ symbolises harmony, unity and continuous progress. The letters ‘SK’ written in the logo resembles the Chinese character, ‘水’, or water. Water is fluid and soft, yet it can wear away rock, which is rigid. The background colour of vibrant yellow symbolises the ‘attainment of excellence and victory’.
