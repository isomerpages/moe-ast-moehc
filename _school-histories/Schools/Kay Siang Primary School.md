#### **School History**
Established in 1969, Kay Siang Primary School was located at Margaret Drive. It began as an English and Chinese Integrated Primary School but subsequently became an English medium school.

In 1985, it merged with Tanglin Girls' School to form Xianglin Primary School. Xianglin Primary School occupied the combined premises of Tanglin Girls’ School and Kay Siang Primary School, which were located next to each other.

In 1987, Xianglin Primary School merged with Belvedere Primary School. The new school was named Belvedere Primary School and occupied Xianglin Primary School's building. In 1990, Belvedere Primary School closed and office buildings were built on the site. Currently, the site hosts the Singapore Environment Council, Executive Counselling & Training Academy and Stanford Academy.
