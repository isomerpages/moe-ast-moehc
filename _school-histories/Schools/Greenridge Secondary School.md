#### **School History**
Greenridge Secondary School started as Dunearn Secondary Technical School (DSTS), which was established in 1964. The school was officially opened on 14 May 1965 by then Deputy Prime Minister Dr Toh Chin Chye.

DSTS played an instrumental role in nation-building during the early years of Singapore’s independence. In the 1960s, Singapore needed more technically trained citizens to meet the rapid industrialisation needs for the economy, and DSTS was one of the first technical schools to be built. Equipped with the best technical facilities of the time, DSTS provided quality technical education to resident students and students from other schools in the vicinity. 

In June 1992, DSTS moved to its present location in Bukit Panjang and was one of the pioneer secondary schools in the Holland-Bukit Panjang constituency. The school was renamed Greenridge Secondary School because of the lush greenery surrounding it and because ‘Bukit Panjang’ means ‘ridge’ in Malay. Greenridge Secondary School was officially opened on 16 July 1994.

The school underwent PRIME upgrading between 2006 and 2009. On 2 July 2010, Greenridge celebrated the official opening of its upgraded campus, which had new facilities such as the Arts Hub, a synthetic school field and an indoor sports hall.

In 2015, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in the use of media to engage learners, which led to the Camera. Lights. Action. Programme. Through this, students are given exposure in news broadcasting in the school’s Scene ONE studio. In 2016, Greenridge was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in arts education. The school aims to develop a sense of aesthetics and to nurture creative and confident individuals who can impact the community through the arts. In 2018, in view of its emphasis on language learning and innovative processes, the school was according the Enhanced Applied Learning Programme in languages. Through this, the school aims to nurture confident and effective communicators in the English language and mother tongues. Students with interest and talent in languages will be nurtured to appreciate biculturalism and groomed to be effectively bilingual.

#### **School Motto**
From Each His Best

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/greenridgesec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest in red, green and gold colours is shaped like a shield to reflect Greenridge Secondary School’s protective role for the students. The school motto, ‘From Each His Best’, exhorts every student to do his or her best in everything. It is stated boldly below the crest as it serves as the guiding principle for all endeavours.

The five arms above the motto represents the strive to move upwards and outwards. They also symbolise the five ways in which the school aims to support the total development of students: cognitive development; aesthetic appreciation; physical growth; inculcation of healthy habits and positive attitudes; and promotion of social cohesion through understanding, appreciation and mutual respect.

#### **School Song**

In Greenridge, we strive to stand<br><br>
Head and shoulders above the rest<br>
In Greenridge, we work and play,<br>
Nurture talents buried deep<br>
As boldly emblazoned on our crest<br>
In Greenridge, we’ll do our best.

Chorus:<br>
From each his best, From each his best<br>
It’s in our hearts at every test<br>
Associate in harmony - Nation, school and family<br>
Loyalty and honour<br>
This we pledge to Greenridge

Oh Greenridge, you fill us with<br>
Joy and pride in all we do<br>
In future we know that still<br>
Our thoughts and memories will be with you<br>
As we grow in stature and maturity<br>
We give our best with dignity
