#### **School History**


Established in 1964 as Dunearn Secondary Technical School (DSTS) at Hillcrest Road, Greenridge Secondary School (GSS) was officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye on 14 May 1965. Designed to meet Singapore's industrial needs, DSTS featured state-of-the-art technical facilities and was located on a small hill between Linden Drive and Hillcrest Road.

In June 1992, DSTS relocated to Bukit Panjang Ring Road and was renamed Greenridge Secondary School to reflect its green surroundings. The co-educational school achieved a balanced male-to-female student ratio. Officially opened on 16 July 1994 by Mr. Lee Yiok Seng, it is one of the pioneer secondary schools in the Bukit Panjang area, having hosted Fajar Secondary School and Zhenghua Secondary School.

In 2023, Greenridge Secondary School and Fajar Secondary School merged to form the new Greenridge Secondary School, with the school campus being relocated to 31 Gangsa Road (location of Fajar Secondary School). Fajar Secondary School had started in 1994 and was temporarily located at Greenridge Secondary prior to its move to Gangsa Road. In 2016, Fajar Secondary School merged with Chestnut Secondary School (CDSS). CDSS comes with a rich history of its own beginning in 1968 when it was officially opened by MP P Selvadurai. Thus, the 2023 merger of Greenridge Secondary School and Fajar Secondary School unified a rich history of the schools and the strengths in uniformed groups, sports, performing arts, Applied Learning, and Learning for Life. Today, Greenridge Secondary School, rooted in the legacy of excellence from DSTS, CDSS and Fajar, stands united and ready to provide a nurturing, dynamic and a technology-rich learning environment for all students and staff. With the merged Greenridge Secondary at Bukit Panjang (long hill), our promise to all students and staff is that there is space for everyone at Greenridge and together we will scale to the top of the ridge to experience a new Dawn (Fajar).
