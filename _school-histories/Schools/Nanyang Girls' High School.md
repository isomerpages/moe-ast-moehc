#### **School History**
Nanyang Girls’ High School was established in 1917 in a rented shophouse at 7 Dhoby Ghaut, near present-day Cathay Cinema. Offering education in Chinese, the school was set up by a group of Chinese businessmen who believed that women should receive education in order to play a more active role in serving their country. Until 1930, the school was known as Singapore Nanyang Girls’ School. The following year, the school system was adjusted to provide three-year Junior Middle and Senior Middle courses. That same year, the school relocated to King’s Road and was renamed Nanyang Girls’ High School. In 1957, it became a government-aided school.

In 1979, Nanyang Girls’ High School became a Special Assistance Plan school, offering both English and Chinese as first languages. In 1984, it was selected to pioneer the Art Elective Programme for artistically talented students. The school gained independent status in 1993. Six years later, in 1999, the school began implementing the Gifted Education Programme and moved to its present campus at 2 Linden Drive in June that year. The Linden Drive campus was designed by alumna Mdm Ling Siew May, who was also the chairperson of the board. The campus was declared open in 2000 by then Senior Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew.&nbsp;

In collaboration with Hwa Chong Institution, Nanyang Girls’ High School started the Integrated Programme in 2004. In the following year, the Bicultural Studies Programme (Chinese) was implemented, and in 2008, the school became the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Chinese Studies and Culture. The present Chinese Language and Culture Programme includes the Bicultural Studies Programme and Chinese Language Elective Programme.

In 2013, Nanyang Girls’ High School became the first girls’ school to be conferred the Singapore Quality Award.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/nanyanggirlshighsch1.png">

The first school logo was a diamond-shaped crest on which the school name, in Chinese characters, was printed against a light blue background. It was designed by a former art teacher from the school, Mdm Chen Jun Wen. In 1968, a small amendment was made to the crest. The present school logo has a diamond-shaped crest superimposed on top of a yellow ring emblem, with the words ‘Nanyang Girls’ High’ on it. This ring emblem rests on top of a yellow banner with the school motto in Chinese.
