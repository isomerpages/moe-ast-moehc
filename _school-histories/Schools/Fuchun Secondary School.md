#### **School History**
Established in 1986, Fuchun Secondary School is a government co-educational school located at 21 Woodlands Avenue 1.  
  
In 1999, the&nbsp;school became single-session. The Fuchun Student Creed was launched in 2003, to create a sense of identity and imbue the Fuchun&nbsp;ICARE&nbsp;values in every student.&nbsp;Fuchun celebrated its 20th&nbsp;year anniversary in 2006, with its first entry into the Singapore Book of records for the largest heart formation made of straw hearts.

The school celebrated the birth of its mascot, Eon, on 15 January 2014. This endearing mascot&nbsp; was collaboratively envisioned by staff and students.&nbsp;The name Eon, is derived from the words ‘eagle’ and ‘lion’ and also makes reference to the notions of eternity and legacy.&nbsp; Eon is&nbsp;an embodiment of the school values.&nbsp;The eagle stands for pride,&nbsp;**integrity**, and&nbsp;**responsibility**&nbsp;whilst the lion embodies&nbsp;**adaptability**,&nbsp;**camaraderie**&nbsp;and the strive for&nbsp;**excellence.**

In 2014,&nbsp;Fuchun Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Innovations in Science and Technology for&nbsp;Sustain-Ability’,&nbsp;and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Values through Dance’.

2016 saw the school’s 30th&nbsp;year in educating and shaping young minds. &nbsp;Eon went through a makeover in 2018 and&nbsp;a more youthful and agile Eon 2.0 joined the Fuchun family.&nbsp;Eon 2.0 is vibrant, dynamic and embodied with the joy of learning. He exemplifies the Fuchun student who is preparing for the future, developing life-long learning attitudes, skills and 21st Century Competencies.

True to Self

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/fuchunsec9.jpg">

The school crest is designed in a stylised ‘F’ to represent the name of the school and the flame of truth. The three little steps beside the flame signify that truth is not always easy to express and must therefore be taken step-by-step. The red&nbsp;colour of the crest symbolises courage to speak the truth.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D8uyG1f-J5HA1BFhlOkVyH8-bGP9AyI_/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a> 

Upon the shoulders of all<br>
Rests the task of discerning truth<br>
And remaining true to oneself<br>
In all we say and do<br>
Say and do

Chorus:<br>
Fuchun, you're our guide and mentor<br>
Within your boundaries we extend our horizon<br>
With what we learn<br>
To prepare us for what's beyond<br>
Fuchun, you're our guiding star<br>
(Fuchun, you're our guiding star)<br>
We pledge to serve as one<br>
Along the pathway of Honour and Truth<br>
And to serve with loyalty to school and nation

Repeat chorus
