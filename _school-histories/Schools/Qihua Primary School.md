#### **School History**
Qihua Primary School was established in 1938 as Kay Wah School by a group of Chinese community leaders led by Mr Neo Tiew. The school offered education in the Chinese medium to the children of Ama Keng village. It was briefly closed during the Japanese Occupation but reopened after the war. Kay Wah expanded from the main school to Branches I and II, with an enrolment of about 2,000 students in its three branches.

The three branches were Kay Wah Main at Tong Hoe Village for upper-primary levels, Kay Wah Branch I at Ama Keng Village and Kay Wah Branch II at Nam Hoe Village for lower-primary levels. The branches were run by three principals to cater to the rising educational needs of the farming community.

In 1976, the school was officially declared a government school. In 1980, Kay Wah I adopted English as its medium of instruction. In 1988, when the farming community in Lim Chu Kang was resettled to set aside the area for military purposes, the school’s three branches merged into one and shifted to its current address in Woodlands and was renamed Qihua Primary School. The literal meaning of ‘Qi Hua’ (启化) means to inspire and educate as it nurtures and prepares its students for the future, regardless of their race or creed.

The school completed its PRIME upgrading in 2001 and PERI upgrading in 2014. It started operations as a single-session school in 2015. In 2018, the school celebrated its 80th anniversary.

Qihua Primary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and the Learning for Life Programme in Sports Development Programme.
