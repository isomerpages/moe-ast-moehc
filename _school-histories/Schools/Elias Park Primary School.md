#### **School History**
Elias Park Primary School (EPPS) was the third primary school constructed in the suburban town of Pasir Ris. Established to meet the demand for primary education in Pasir Ris, the school was part of the Public Works Department’s fourth Primary School Building Programme.

EPPS started functioning on 3 January 1995 with a student population of 770 in 24 classes, and it was officially declared opened on 12 July 1997.

The school underwent PRIME upgrading from 2002 to 2004, and then PERI upgrading from 2015 to 2018. From 3 January 2011, the school became single session.

EPPS has been accorded two Learning for Life Programmes: Character In Action@EPPS and Arts Creatively Expressed (ACE @ Elias). The first anchors on the school’s niche in National Education (NE), which broadens Eliasians’ perspectives on national issues through events linked to NE messages, Character and Citizenship Education and the teaching of school values. The latter emphasises aesthetics and aims to develop a love for art and music in Eliasians through exposure, experience and appreciation.

#### **School Motto**
Endeavour and Persevere

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/aliasparkpri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The School Crest is a composition of blue on yellow. The strong blue represents civility, seriousness and respect whilst the bright yellow, warmth and cheerfulness. The superimposition of these contrasting colours indicates the desire for a balanced approach to education.

The School Crest possesses the characteristic of duality in design. The leaf, which signifies the sanctity of life, transforms into an image of a heart complete with twin chambers. The vessels of each chamber work to form the letters 'E' and 'P'.

'E' and 'P' are synonymous with the ideals of 'Endeavour' and 'Persevere'. These words, which rest on an open book, articulate that the pursuit of knowledge should ultimately lead to the cultivation of the soul. Success, symbolized by the laurel, is measured by these values held within the heart.

The bold outer ring stands for unity and cohesiveness among staff and students – the vision of the school as one big family.

United are we, in this happy place<br>
Earnest and disciplined, at work and at play;<br>
Cheerfully caring, cheerfully sharing<br>
Helping one another along the way<br>
Filling our minds with knowledge<br>
Growing in wisdom day by day<br>
Undaunted are we, in all that we do<br>
Though it may be uphill, all the way.<br>
Elias Park, Elias Park<br>
With you as my guide;<br>
We hope to face the future<br>
And to serve our nation with pride.<br>
Elias Park, Elias Park<br>
With you as my guide;<br>
