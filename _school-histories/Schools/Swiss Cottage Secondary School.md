The crest is headed by five stars symbolising equality, peace, progress, justice and democracy. These are ideals on which a brotherhood of people can be built. Below is a torch signifying the light of knowledge and the love of learning. Encompassing it are five rings symbolising sports and how they connect people. The five horizontal bands denote the five houses as rivals in competition but steadfast in fraternity.
