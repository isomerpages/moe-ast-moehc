#### **School History**
Ping Yi Secondary School was founded as Pin Ghee Public School in 1930 on Changi Road. It was renamed as Ping Yi Secondary School in 1983, a government co-educational school catering to the schooling needs of children in the Chai Chee neighbourhood. On 24 September 1985, Ping Yi Secondary School was officially opened. &nbsp;

In 2005, Ping Yi piloted Restorative Practices and began its journey to develop a school culture that is based on positive teacher–student and student–student relationships. Restorative Practices have since become the school’s trademark. In 2006, Ping Yi completed PRIME upgrading and the new campus was officially opened on 3 August 2007.

In an affirmation of the school’s efforts in nurturing students to be creative and inventive thinkers, Ping Yi attained niche status in design education in 2011. In the following year, Ping Yi was conferred the prestigious Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course in recognition of the school’s innovative practices that raised the quality of education in the Normal Course.&nbsp;In 2013, the school was designated the East Zone Centre of Excellence in Design Education to guide and support schools in their drive for innovation and creativity.

In 2014, the school commemorated its 30th anniversary. As part of the celebrations, staff and students of Ping Yi set a new record for the longest human chain walk in the Singapore Book of Records. In the same year, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, focusing on Design and Aeronautical Engineering. The programme offers students an opportunity to understand aeronautical science, and apply their scientific knowledge and design skills in areas beyond the classroom. The school’s Learning for Life Programme is in Community and Youth Leadership, focusing on Leadership through Character and Citizenship Education. It strives to nurture every Ping Yian to be a servant leader, strong and upright in character, with a heart for others and Singapore.

In 2016, Ping Yi Secondary School and Bedok Town Secondary School merged to form the present Ping Yi Secondary School. In 2018, the school launched the photo book,&nbsp;_Chai Chee, Our Home_, which provides a visual narrative of the warm and vibrant Chai Chee community. That same year, the school was once again conferred the Lee Hsien Loong Award for Innovations in the Normal Course.
