#### **School History**
Established in 1879, Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) became a government school in 1903. From its original location at Bras Basah Road, the school moved to Queen Street in 1928 and became a full-fledged girls’ school. In 1959, the school moved to Anderson Road and in 2019, it relocated to its current campus at Braddell.  
  
RGS was one of the first schools in Singapore to offer the Gifted Education Programme in 1984. It became an independent school in 1993 led by a Board of Governors (BOG). The BOG together with the school leaders set the directions for the school and has provided strong support for the staff and students to meet the rapidly changing education needs. The Independent status allowed for the direct recruitment of teachers and the flexibility to trailblaze, introducing innovative programmes to promote the total development of students.  
  
In 2003, the Parents for RGS (PRGS) Association was registered as a society. Aiming to forge a strong school-home partnership in the holistic development of our students, PRGS connects parents, students and the school on many fronts. They provide workshops on parenting and support the school in a wide range of school events. In recent years, they have also been providing scholarships for students.  
  
In 2004, RGS, together with Raffles Institution (RI) and Raffles Junior College (RJC), introduced the Raffles Programme (RP), a 6-year integrated programme that aims to provide an enriched and differentiated curriculum within a vibrant environment of scholarship and service. The programme prepares students for the demands of a fast-changing world where they will be expected to lead and serve community and nation. Students are offered multiple platforms to think incisively and reflectively to develop personal mastery and a sense of the common good.  
  
The Raffles Academy (RA), the talent development arm of the RP, was set up in 2007 to provide advanced learning for those with special aptitude and passions. In 2018, following a comprehensive review, RA2.0 was introduced to offer more flexibility, accessibility and options to students while catering to their varied interests and talents.  
  
In 2010, the RGS Pedagogical Research Lab was set up, continuing RGS’ emphasis on educational research. The Lab was renamed the Centre for Pedagogical Research and Learning in 2014 to reflect its growth in Research, Consultancy and Professional Learning. The Centre provides professional development opportunities and consultancy for RGS staff as well as teachers nationwide. The specialist track was created as an alternative career pathway, with teacher-specialists who provide thought leadership.  
  
In 2011, RGS and RI introduced the 4-year Raffles Diploma (RD), a certification to recognise student participation and achievements in five developmental domains: Cognitive, Character and Leadership, Community and Citizenship, Arts and Aesthetics, Sports and Health. The RD complements the GCE ‘A’ Level certificate in capturing the holistic development of every Rafflesian.  
  
In July 2014, the RGS Alumnae (RGSA) Association was formed. RGSA provides a platform for alumnae to connect with each other and with students of RGS. RGSA also works with the school to promote and develop a community embodying the Rafflesian spirit and values.  
  
In October 2019, RGS moved to a new campus at Braddell. The new campus enhances opportunities for community engagement and innovation. And so begins a new chapter of RGS’ journey as a school that has never wavered from its mission of nurturing girls who will contribute to society.

The colours of the school crest are the standard colours of the House of Sir Stamford Raffles: green, white and black. The open book symbolises knowledge, and the burning torch represents the commitment to forge character and develop life skills.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

From High Olympus  
  
From High Olympus flows to us the glory, On us the sacred fire descends. Rise, sisters, rise, the world is all before ye. Fear not to grasp what fortune sends.

Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

A little while the sun shines high above us, And youth's elixir fills our veins, The magic fire that moves the gods to love us, The fire by which the will attains.

Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

So heart to heart, we'll scale the heights of learning, No mean desires our days shall shame, Whole-hearted, true, with pride and ardour burning On, sisters, on to life and fame.

Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.
