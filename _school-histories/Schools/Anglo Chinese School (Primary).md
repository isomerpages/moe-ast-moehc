#### **School History**
Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) is one of seven schools of the ACS Family, the others being ACS (Junior), ACS (Barker Road), ACS (Independent), Anglo-Chinese Junior College, ACS (International) and ACS Jakarta.  

ACS was founded by Reverend William Fitzjames Oldham when he started a class of 13 boys in a shophouse at 70 Amoy Street on 1 March 1886. Enrolment grew quickly to 104 in the first year. By 1887, it had moved to 1 Canning Rise. ACS also served as a boarding school, attracting many students from neighbouring countries. By 1896, ACS had become the largest school in the Straits Settlements.

ACS was operating as a full school with both primary and secondary levels, and the building soon became inadequate for the burgeoning student population. Therefore, a new school was built in 1928 at 126 Cairnhill Road to house the secondary school.

Anglo-Chinese Primary School, as ACS (Primary) was known then, remained at Canning Rise. The school had both the morning and afternoon sessions. By the 1950s, the building could no longer meet the needs of the expanding school population. Thus, it was torn down to make way for a new building in 1959, which still stands today repurposed as the National Archives of Singapore.

In 1994, Anglo-Chinese Primary School vacated 1 Canning Rise and moved to Barker Road to become the primary school section of ACS (Barker Road), a full school that accepted its first cohort of Secondary One boys. In 1998, the primary section of ACS (Barker Road) separated from the school, and was rechristened ACS (Primary). In 2002, it began operating as a single-session school.

ACS (Primary) has been offering the Gifted Education Programme since 1984.
