#### **School Motto**
Wisdom and Grace

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/westgrovepri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Shaped like a shield, the badge represents honour and loyalty to uphold for the school. The black outline demonstrates boldness in taking on challenges. The colour green signifies freshness of mind and body towards learning. Like pages of an open book, the colour blue shows learning with an open mind.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

At West Grove we march on with our peers<br>
Together we achieve through the years<br>
We build we shape we declare what we have we learn to share

Wisdom and grace we totally embrace<br>
With wisdom and grace we’ll win the race<br>
Wisdom and grace we totally embrace<br>
With wisdom and grace we’ll win the race<br>
With one heart one soul and one mind<br>
With renewed faith upwards we will climb<br>
New heights new hopes and new dreams<br>
Together we achieve as a team
