#### **School History**
Jervois Primary School was established in 1986 following the merger of Jervois East School and Jervois West School. Jervois Primary School was located on the Jervois East and West School campuses.  
  
Jervois Primary School closed down in 1989. In the same year, the Singapore School for the Deaf moved into the site. However, the Singapore School for the Deaf at Jervois Road later closed down and from 1989 to 2006, the Association for Persons with Special Needs (APSN) Jervois Special School used Jervois West Primary School’s building. In 2006, APSN Jervois Special School shifted to a new site in Ang Mo Kio. Jervois Primary School’s building was subsequently demolished to make way for residential housing.
