#### **School History**
Peixin Primary School was established in January 1985. It was located at the junction of Yishun Avenue 2 and Yishun Ring Road. &nbsp;&nbsp;

The school introduced Life Sciences as part of its curriculum by launching several programmes in Bio-Life Sciences. In 1999, it initiated the Plant Tissue Culture (PTC) project, and in 2000, it also set up a PTC Laboratory. The aim of the project was to provide students with first-hand experience on plant biotechnology and opportunities to acquire thinking and research skills. Other programmes included orchid hybridisation, aquaponics and hydroponics. In addition, the butterfly enclosure in the school enabled students to observe and study the growth of butterflies, beginning from the egg stage and moving through the larva and pupa stages.

Peixin Primary School also had a strong IT culture. Students from as early as primary one began IT lessons, and graduated in primary six with a high proficiency level in IT and strong familiarity with multi-media learning tools. In 1999, the school hosted an IT-in-Education Seminar for five schools, and showcased the innovative and successful efforts of teachers.

In 2003, Peixin Primary built a new, ocean-themed library, called Peixin Lighthouse. The school published a regular newsletter, titled&nbsp;_Peixin Pulse_&nbsp;and later, in the 2000s,&nbsp;_Kaleidoscope_.

Peixin Primary School also had excellent achievements in various sports and arts competitions. In 1999, the school won Gold for their WITS Project, “Peixin Heartwaves”, for Quality Customer Service in Schools. In 2002, the school’s concert band won Gold in the Singapore Youth Festival, while the hockey team also won Gold in the National Inter-Primary School competition.

In 2009, Peixin Primary School merged with Yishun Primary School.
