#### **School History**
Belvedere Primary School was established in 1988 as a result of the merger of Xianglin Primary School and Belvedere School. Belvedere Primary School was housed in the Xianglin Primary School building at 370 Tanglin Road.  
  
Over time, the enrolment in Belvedere Primary School gradually declined due to population shifts in the estate and the school closed in December 1990.
