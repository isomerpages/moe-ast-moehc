#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Dorset Primary School was located along Dorset Road. The school started as an all-boys school but later accepted female students.  
  
In the mid-1970s, Dorset Primary School relocated to a new site between Thomson Road and Gentle Road. The school campus at Dorset Road housed Ang Mo Kio Primary School's Primary One students for three months. This was because the latter's school building had yet to be constructed. After Ang Mo Kio Primary School shifted to its own site, the old campus of Dorset Primary School was demolished. In 1976, Housing & Development Board (HDB) flats were built on this land.  
  
In 1981, Dorset Primary School closed down. Dorset Primary School students were given alternative places in Catholic High School (Primary) or nearby primary schools. Catholic High School (Primary) relocated to Dorset Primary School’s Thomson campus. In 1992, Catholic High School (Primary) shifted to Bishan. Since 1992, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) has occupied the site of Dorset Primary School’s Thomson campus.

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs. Yap Ah Hian (1971-1978)
