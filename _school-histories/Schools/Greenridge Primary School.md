#### **School History**
Greenridge Primary School started in January 1995 to cater to the growing demand for primary schools in Bukit Panjang New Town. In January 1996, 12 more classes were added and they were housed in another school in Chua Chu Kang New Town. In January 1997, the school moved into its campus at Jelapang Road.

In 2003, Greenridge Primary School completed its PRIME upgrading. In 2005, the school was awarded the inaugural Programme for School-Based Excellence in the niche area of Citizenship Education. The school&nbsp;was&nbsp;awarded the Lee Kuan Yew National Education Award. In 2010, Greenridge Primary School was conferred the Outstanding Development Award for National Education. In 2011, the school was also accorded the West Zone Centre of Excellence in Character and Citizenship Education.&nbsp;In 2015, Greenridge Primary School became a single-session school and completed its PERI upgrading.&nbsp;

In 2016, Greenridge Primary School began to offer its Learning for Life Programme, NE2+, which stands for ‘Nurturing Ethical and Effective Leaders with Positive Mindset’. The programme aims to equip students with the values and competencies that would guide and prepare them for the globalised VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) world, while staying rooted and true to Singapore, thereby fulfilling the school vision of ‘Engaged Learners, Caring Leaders’.

Since 2014, the school&nbsp;uses Positive Education as a whole school approach to enhance student motivation and engagement through cultivating positive attitudes, building their personal strengths and finding deeper happiness in their lives and communities. The power of positive education can enable student to better manage their life stressors and reach their full potential.

In 2020, the school embarks on the journey of a structured whole-school programme in coding and an application for Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Computational Thinking. It will leverage niches like strong CCAs in Robotics and Infocomm Club as well as partnership with IMDA.

#### **School Crest**

The three peaks in the background symbolises our school motto: Gracious, Responsible and Public-Spirited.  
The fourth peak in the foreground represents the wholesome Greenridgean who is ready and prepared to face the challenges ahead and the fifth peak in the centre represents the nurturing of a global citizen ready to serve the broader community and beyond.  
The ridge as a whole symbolises the effect Greenridgeans will have on the community, by having the strength of character, integrity and role-modeling the values of exemplary citizenship.
