#### **School History**
Da Qiao Primary School started in 1936 as a Chinese-medium public school to serve the education needs of the community at North Bridge Road. It was then known as Tai Keou School (公立大侨学校). The word ‘大’ (_da_) in the name refers to Dabu, the Chinese province where the founder, Mr Qiu Lin Rong, was from, and ‘侨’ (_qiao_) refers to Chinese immigrants in Singapore at the time.

To better support the school, members of the Char Yong (Dabu) Association came on board to serve as the school’s board of directors in 1939. In the same year, the school shifted to Lim Tua Tow Road at Hougang (后港五条石). The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation and reopened at Lorong Tai Seng (大成巷) in 1947. In 1964, it relocated to Jalan Paya and remained there until the end of 1980.

In 1981, Da Qiao Primary School was established as a government school in Ang Mo Kio. The school name ‘Da Qiao’, a hanyu pinyin version of Tai Keou, was chosen to continue the name of the former Tai Keou School and to recognise the contributions by members of the Char Yong (Dabu) Association. In January 1982, the new school started operating at 10, Ang Mo Kio Street 54 with 38 classes of 1,200 students. The school was officially opened on 22 July 1983.

Following the PRIME upgrading programme, Da Qiao Primary School moved to a new campus at 8 Ang Mo Kio Street 54 on 8 December 1999. In 2000, it merged with Chong Boon Primary School to form the present Da Qiao Primary School. The new campus was officially opened on 22 February 2002.

From 2010, Da Qiao Primary was one of 16 prototype schools that embarked on Holistic Assessment and was in forefront to share best practices on the implementation of Holistic Assessment. The year 2014 marked a key milestone when Positive Education was leveraged as a whole-of-school approach to develop students’ well-being. Da Qiao Primary became a reference school for Positive Education after organising the inaugural symposium, SymPosEd 2017. To celebrate its legacy before the merger with Jing Shan Primary school, Da Qiao held a Positive Education Learning Festival in 2018 to share its best practices with the fraternity.

Da Qiao Primary School’s Learning for Life Programme, FLOURISH @ DQ, aims to develop character strengths, resilience and mindfulness through values in action. FLOURISH @ DQ focuses on enhancing well-being through the provision of learning experiences where values can be put into action.
