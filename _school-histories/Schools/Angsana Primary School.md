#### **School History**
Angsana Primary School was established in 2015 as a merger of the former Qiaonan Primary School and Griffiths Primary School.  
  
The school’s Applied Learning Programme in Developing Problem Solvers through Computational Thinking and Learning for Life Programme in Nurturing 21st Century Leaders through Learning of Lifeskills, were rolled out in 2017.  
  
Previously named Kiau Nam School, Qiaonan Primary School was founded by the Wenzhou Clan Association in 1933. From its humble beginnings in a rented house on Lorong Koo Chye, the school expanded and moved to Lorong Tai Seng in 1938, and then to Paya Lebar Road in 1940. When the Second World War broke out in Singapore in 1942, the school was forced to close down. After the war, the school was rebuilt by directors, teachers and alumni, and it reopened in October 1945 at Paya Lebar Road. On 1 April 1957, the school became a government-aided school, and in 1984, a full government school. In 1985, Kiau Nam School merged with Pulau Tekong Primary School, and the new school was located at 15 Tampines Street 11, where it was renamed Qiaonan Primary School.  
  
Originally named Towner Road School because of its location, Griffiths School was established on 1 June 1950.   Griffiths School was the first of 90 schools scheduled to be built under the plan to provide free and compulsory elementary education. The school was named in honour of Rt. Hon. Mr James Griffiths, then Secretary of the British Colonies, who officially opened the school. The school had two sessions with two different principals. The morning session was known as Griffiths School 1, and the afternoon, Griffiths School 2. In 1982, the school was closed, and the students were transferred to Moulmein Primary School. Griffiths School was re-established as Griffiths Primary School in Tampines in 1988.

#### **School Motto**
Above and Beyond

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/angsanapri1.png" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The Angsana Crest represents the emergence of the SG50 school, established in the year of Singapore’s Jubilee year, built upon the strong heritage of two schools from early Singapore.  The school is named after the majestic Angsana Tree which provides shade and shelter with its lush foliage and expansive canopy.  
  
The silhouette of the letter “A” is symbolic of the name of the school.  The two lines merge to form the tree trunk, leading to a circular crown of the tree.  The tree represents the holistic education offered to all students, promising growth and potential for a bright and better future.  The tree rises up and goes above and beyond the frame of the letter “A”, signifying the aspirations of the staff and students to continuously strive and aim for excellence in all our pursuits. The heart signifies the importance of character and citizenship education in the school’s programmes, guided by the R3n (仁) values – Respect, Resilience, Responsibility and Integrity.

The colours<br>
**Red** –  Heart to Care:  symbolic of our love and appreciation for our family, school, community and nation<br>
**Green** – Committed to Learn:  for an environment of harmony and growth that we will create in our school<br>
**Blue** – Steadfast to Serve:  for honesty and the strong sense of responsibility that we will seek to nurture in everyone who walks through the portals of our school
