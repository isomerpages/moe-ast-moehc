#### **School History**
Cambridge School was opened in March 1963, near the junction of Cambridge and Carlisle Roads. The school had 24 classrooms that catered for as many as 2,000 students in both morning and afternoon sessions. Cambridge School was the 20th school opened by the Singapore government in the early sixties.  
  
Cambridge Primary School accepted students from neighbouring Norfolk Primary School in 1984 when the latter closed that year.  
  
In 1998, Cambridge Primary School closed. Its premises, together with that of the neighbouring Norfolk Primary School, were converted into a foreign student dormitory called the Carlisle Hostel. The buildings of the former Cambridge and Norfolk Schools are still standing today, although they have been vacated for years.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/cambridgepri1.png">

The school crest is represented by a book and torch on the left and a mystical creature on the right.

The book is symbolic of knowledge and the flame signifies the everlasting quest for knowledge.

The right mystical creature represents preparedness in forging ahead while its claws represent tenacity and courage in overcoming obstacles in the search for excellence.
