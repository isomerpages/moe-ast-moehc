#### **School History**
Ahmad Ibrahim Primary School (AIPS) started in 1995 and is named after Mr Ahmad Ibrahim, then Member of Parliament for Sembawang, who served as Minister for Health and later Minister for Labour in the early years of Singapore’s independence. The school’s heritage stands as a reminder of the courage, determination and pride of Singapore’s leaders who dedicated their lives to the building of the nation. Functioning with a total of 23 classes in 1995, the students and staff were mainly from Sembawang School, which had closed down in November 1994. The school has been functioning as single session since 2003, after the completion of PRIME.&nbsp;  
  
Having celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2015, AIPS has seen many milestone successes. In 2016, the school was recognised for its Character and Citizenship Education and partnerships, which earned AIPS the Best Practice Awards in both areas. As such, the school was also invited to share its best practices on strategic partnerships on platforms such as the 2016 Excellence-in-Action and the 2017 Ministry of Education EXCELFest.&nbsp;  
  
AIPS was designated as a Cluster N2 Centre of Learning for Chinese (Primary) and awarded niche status for the Programme for School-Based Excellence for Character and Citizenship Education in 2011, and this became the school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in 2014. AIPS’s LLP, From Values into Action – Nurturing Community-based Student Leaders Programme, focuses on the students’ community involvement and leadership development. Besides LLP, AIPS has also attained its Applied Learning Programme (ALP) status in 2016 through the Sustainability Education – Nurturing Students to be Stewards of Our Environment programme. The progressive programmes conducted through ALP develop skills, knowledge and values that promote behaviour in support of a sustainable environment. The learning experiences aim to create the students’ awareness of their responsibility towards the quality of the environment and conserving precious resources as well as to hone socio-emotional competencies and 21st-century skills.
