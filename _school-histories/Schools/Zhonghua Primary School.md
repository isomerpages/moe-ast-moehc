#### **School History**
Zhonghua Primary School was established in 1911 as Chung Hwa Girls’ School. In 1951, the school became a full school: the primary section was on Niven Road and the secondary section on Bartley Road. In 1957, Chung Hwa Girls’ School became a government-aided school.

In 1980, the primary school ceased operations. In 1986, Chung Hwa Girls’ High School moved to its present location at Serangoon Avenue 4 and was renamed Zhonghua Secondary School.

Zhonghua Primary School was rebuilt next to Zhonghua Secondary School. In 1987, the school operated as single-session. In 1989, the school was officially declared open. In 2001, the school underwent PRIME upgrading. &nbsp;

Diligence Before Success

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/zhonghuapri1.png">

The school crest shows two letters ‘Z’s, one upright and the other inverted to signify the school’s emphasis in training its students and staff to be flexible in their outlook in life, particularly in problem-solving. The school crest is solid in structure, representing its belief that a school that is well-founded will flourish. The colour turquoise represents vibrant youth.

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15i9CEhD-9pNqrm1JQ9HismXmi8ysQ6at/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">**♫ Listen**</a>

When nineteen eighty-seven dawned<br>
The torch of Zhonghua was first shone<br>
Calling us all who belong to her<br>
To set our goals and achieve them together

Chorus:<br>
In all we do, from each his best<br>
Diligence will bring us success<br>
Aiming high always on the go<br>
Doing well today even better tomorrow
