#### **School History**
Evergreen Primary was established in January 1999. The school started functioning with 22 classes of pupils from Primary One to Primary Four. It was temporarily housed in two separate campuses at Woodlands Ring Primary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary School. It then moved to its present premises on 22 March 1999, and was officially opened on 6 July 2002. The school celebrated its 10th&nbsp;and 20th&nbsp;anniversary in 2009 and 2019 respectively.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Learning Through the Arts and Learning in the Arts’, provides every student with authentic learning experiences and develops their 21st-century competencies – particularly the development of socio-emotional competencies. These include the building of self-esteem, confidence and the school’s shared values.

In 2018, the school introduced two signature programmes – Multi-Modal Programme and That’s Great, It’s Friday – to provide a wide range of activities and opportunities for students to discover their interests and passion.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/evergreenpri1.jpg">

Our school crest has the shape of a leaf consisting of 5 parts that represent the 5 school values that shape the beliefs, attitudes and actions of our students and staff.

The 3 leaves at the base of the crest represent the tripartite relationship between teachers, parents and the community at large which is integral for the holistic development of the students in achieving the Desired Outcomes of Education.

The open book embodies the school’s motto in developing every individual with both the intrinsic value of learn for life and building a sound character in our students. The computer symbolizes the need for digital literacy in their quest for knowledge.

The colour green depicts youthfulness and constant renewal while yellow depicts optimism and imagination.

In 1999, Evergreen was founded<br>
To nurture youth so fine<br>
We raise a golden banner<br>
Which proudly proclaim<br>
For each of our endeavour<br>
This is our aim

Evergreen, our Evergreen<br>
Pure in Act and Joy in Learning<br>
We’ll give our best<br>
We’ll do our part<br>
To live life with a golden heart<br>
Evergreen, you are the reason to be keen<br>
Evergreen, you give the vision we have seen<br>
We’ll stand up tall with heads held high<br>
We’ll give you all to touch the sky

A vision to be bold<br>
A mission to uphold<br>
Together we will strive<br>
We’ll be strong and happy<br>
We’ll be warm and true<br>
One day we will see<br>
Our vision coming true
