#### **School History**
Hua Yi Secondary School started in 1956 as the first government Chinese middle school, located on Fowlie Road. It was then known as Hua Yi Government Chinese Middle School. In April 1957, with a rising enrolment, the school moved to Winstedt Road. Months later in December 1957, Hua Yi was housed in its own building on Margaret Drive.

In 1971, Hua Yi’s student population reached 2,207, with 40 secondary and 17 pre-university classes. Towards the late 1970s, enrolment in Chinese schools decreased gradually. In 1979, Hua Yi started English classes and became a mixed-medium school. The school was renamed ‘Hua Yi Secondary School’ and ceased the enrolment of pre-university students.

In 1983, Hua Yi relocated to a new, well-equipped campus on Depot Road, and was officially opened on 26 April 1985. In December 1999, the school moved to its present premises at Jurong West Street 42 to serve residents in the area.

Then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew visited Hua Yi on two occasions, in 1959 and in 1969. The second visit was for the 150th anniversary of the founding of modern Singapore. In 2016, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was the guest-of-honour at Hua Yi’s 60th anniversary celebration.

Today, Hua Yi aims to be a school for inculcating values, inspiring talents and impacting communities. The school’s core values are the four virtues of benevolence (仁), justice (义), wisdom (智) and togetherness (群). The school aspires to nurture their students to be passionate learners, resilient leaders, empathetic contributors and glocalised citizens, who are grounded in values and ready to make a difference to society.

Hua Yi’s heritage lies in its nurturing of _xinyao_ (a genre of local Mandarin music) talent and bonsai cultivation. Hua Yians composed the award-winning _xinyao_ song ‘亲爱的你’, and the original compositions ‘华义人’ and ‘根在华苑’ have bonded different student cohorts. Hua Yi is the only school in Singapore with a bonsai garden, and many of the plants are between 30 and 50 years old.

Hua Yians participate actively in sports and the performing arts. Girls’ volleyball is recognised as the school’s niche sport. In 2018, Hua Yi organised the Montage Aesthetics Concert to showcase its talents in aesthetics and the performing arts.

In 1967 and 1978, Hua Yi performed a mass dance for the years’ National Day Parades. In 2019, Hua Yi was part of a mass dance performance celebrating the nation’s bicentennial at the National Day Parade.
