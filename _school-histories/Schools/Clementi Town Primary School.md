#### **School History**
Clementi Town Primary School was established on 2 January 1980. It began with an enrolment of 599 students in 15 classes. The school was officially declared open on 20 November 1981. It was the first primary school to open in Clementi New Town.&nbsp;  
  
In 1981, the school established a Reading Clinic with the assistance of Miss Louise Clarke, an educational psychologist. A group of teachers were trained by Miss Clarke to prepare special teaching materials and to conduct the Clinic outside curriculum time. The programme aimed to build up students’ interest in reading.&nbsp;  
  
The school was also actively involved in community events, with organised visits to the Movement of Intellectually Disabled of Singapore, the Muslim Orphanage Home, Villa Francis and St Andrew’s Cathedral for the Aged.  
  
In 2001, Clementi Town Primary School merged with Clementi North Primary School to become Clementi Primary School.
