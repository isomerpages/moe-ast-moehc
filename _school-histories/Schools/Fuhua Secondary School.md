#### **School History**
  

Fuhua Secondary School (FHSS) is a government co-educational school located in Jurong. Founded in 1999, the school welcomed its first batch of students in 2000. It was officially declared open in 2002.

In 2007, FHSS was recognised as a niche school in robotics, an acknowledgement of her effort to develop students with a passion and talent for robotics to actively hone their skills in robotic engineering and programming. In 2009, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary with the opening of the indoor sports hall, to encourage Fuhuanites to pursue a physically active lifestyle.

In 2015, FHSS embarked on the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Forensic Science@Fuhua’ to enable Fuhuanites to connect academic knowledge with the real world through experiential learning. It focuses on inculcating scientific and interdisciplinary thinking skills through uncovering forensic techniques used in crime scene investigation to solve crimes. In 2016, the Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership was implemented. Anchored on servant leadership, it seeks to nurture compassionate leaders who will be a force for good and inspire others to also make a positive difference to their community and beyond.

Over the years, with strong support from stakeholders, improvements were made to the school’s infrastructure to support its commitment to an all-round education. In 2019, to commemorate the school’s 20th anniversary, a Heritage Gallery was opened. Featuring the school’s evolution, milestones and alumni, it aims to preserve the history and heritage of the school as well as inspire and remind current students of the potential for success that the school can nurture. In 2019, the SPADE (Studio, Playroom, Art Appreciation Corner, Digital &amp; Media Room and the Exhibition Gallery) was also opened to inspire students to explore the aesthetics.

In 2020, the library, the ILLUMIND, was transformed into a dynamic learning resource center, ensuring that learning and reading inspire fresh flow of ideas. The Living Lab was opened in 2022 to champion sustainability and environmental consciousness. Here, teachers conduct inquiry-based lessons where students study the effects of variables on plant growth and appreciate the application of science and geography in agriculture. A new learning space, the i-GEN Studio, was opened in 2024 to nurture a maker mindset, where learning through experimentation, creativity and technical knowhow combine to produce new ideas.

In 2024, the school celebrated her silver jubilee.
