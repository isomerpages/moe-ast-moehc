#### **School History**
Fuhua Secondary School (FHSS) is a government co-educational school located at 5 Jurong West Street 41. Founded in 1999, the school welcomed its first batch of students in 2000. FHSS was officially declared open in 2002.

In 2007, FHSS was recognised as a niche school in robotics, which provides a platform for students with a passion and talent for robotics to actively hone their skills in robotic engineering and programming. In 2009, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary with the opening of the indoor sports hall, which features new facilities such as three multipurpose function rooms and a gymnasium to allow Fuhua students (affectionately known as Fuhuanites) to pursue a physically active lifestyle.

In 2011, FHSS was recognised as a niche school in uniformed groups for its outstanding leadership and character development through the four uniformed groups: National Cadet Corps (Land), National Police Cadet Corps, Red Cross Youth and Sea Scouts.

In 2015, FHSS was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Forensic Science@Fuhua’. The two-year programme aims to enable Fuhuanites to connect academic knowledge with the real world through experiential learning. It focuses on inculcating scientific and interdisciplinary thinking skills through the delivery of lessons built on teaching various forensic techniques used in crime scene investigation. In 2016, FHSS was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in Community Youth Leadership. It seeks to equip students with leadership skills and provide service learning opportunities for them to engage and make a difference in the world.

In 2017, with strong support from the School Advisory Committee, improvements were made to the school’s infrastructure to strengthen teaching and learning. The Active Learning Laboratory was opened to promote the joy of teaching and learning among teachers and students. In 2018, the student hub, the WHALE (Where Happiness and Learning Exist) was officially opened during the school’s 19th Speech Day. The WHALE provides a safe and supportive environment for students to engage in meaningful activities after school hours.

The school celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2019.

The crest is made up of an open book and a rising flame against the background of four diagonal blue stripes. The base of the crest features a running banner with five red stripes at the sides. The book represents the school’s quest for knowledge, while the flame symbolises its commitment to and desire for continuous learning. The four diagonal stripes represent the multiracial composition of students who share the commitment in the quest for knowledge and continuous learning.

The three colours of the crest are red, gold and blue. Red symbolises the passion of serving the country, continuous learning and the innovative spirit. Gold symbolises the school’s desire and relentless effort in striving for excellence. Blue represents the fusion of thoughts and esprit de corps.
