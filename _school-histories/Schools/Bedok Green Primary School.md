#### **School History**

Bedok Green Primary School (BGPS) was established in January 2002 as a result of the merger of Bedok View Primary School and Bedok South Primary School. The school started with a population of 2,153 students in 53 classes and a teaching staff of 85 teachers including seven heads of department. The school was built under the Ministry of Education’s Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing schools (PRIME) at the site of the former Bedok South Primary School and was officially opened on 18 July 2003. Located at 1 Bedok South Avenue 2, BGPS celebrated its 10th Anniversary in 2011. The school also celebrated its 20th Anniversary in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, launched the opening of its new Makerspace, The Imaginarium, buried a time capsule for re-opening in the year 2031, and set a new Singapore Book of Records for ‘Largest Display of Handcrafted Photo Frames’ on 9 July 2021.

During the COVID-19 pandemic years of 2020 to 2022, even though many physical school activities were curtailed as part of Safe Management Measures, the school persevered in providing the best possible education for BGPians by adapting to the new normal through the reinforcement of school values, especially that of Resilience. Staff professional development was also focused on blended learning and differentiated instruction to upskill teachers in these competencies. The curriculum was further developed and strengthened to inculcate the mindset of The Leader In Me, and 7 habits to nurture positive behaviour and character. As Singapore emerged from the pandemic and transited back to DORSCON Green in 2023, likewise, BGPS learned from the lessons of the pandemic years by not only resuming full physical activities as part of its comprehensive total curriculum, the desired student outcomes of a BGPian were fully unpacked in alignment with the school vision of Empowered Learners, Persons of Strength and Character to ensure that BGPS is a school that brings out every child’s personal best.
