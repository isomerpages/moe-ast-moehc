#### **School History**
First Toa Payoh Primary School started in 1968 in Lorong 1, Toa Payoh. In 1979, the school started two pre-primary classes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The pre-primary classes ceased in 1989.

In 2002, the school merged with Braddell, San Shan and Westlake primary schools, and relocated to its present premises at Lorong 8, Toa Payoh. First Toa Payoh Primary School started operating as a single-session school in 2005.

The school aims to use Literacy through Photography (LTP), its Learning for Life Programme, to nurture self-directed and confident learners who are savvy in information and communications technology, and can articulate their thoughts and inspirations through photography. LTP also seeks to develop active contributors who can cooperate and collaborate in teams during photography sessions, and to nurture concerned citizens who can portray green efforts and raise awareness of environmental issues through photography.

#### **School Motto**
Making Impact

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/firsttpypri1.png">

The school logo consists of each of the first letters of the school name, FTPP, that converge on a target. The different shading of the letters represents the four schools that have come together to form our school, ‘S’ shown in the centre.

The words of the motto, “MAKING IMPACT” also converge on the target centre to symbolise our focus on achieving success and excellence in our school. From the target centre, the motto and school letters radiate outwards to symbolise our mission to impact on the lives of not only our children but their families, community and beyond.

#### **School Song**
<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t9DmK5SGSD9vhKeAlSfvMjQCL4rJpFQ7/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a> 

Here's a place we learn what is right and wrong<br>
Here's a place where our bodies will grow strong<br>
Our hearts and minds learning throughout our lives<br>
This is our mission song

We will hold on to each other's hand<br>
Learn to love the beauty inside each one<br>
As we grow together to do all we can<br>
We will fly higher and higher

Chorus<br>
Love and trust is what we'll hold on to<br>
Persevere with openness in all that we do<br>
Stand firm with respect and integrity<br>
This is what we aim to be<br>
In First Toa Payoh Primary

Bridge<br>
The world is our home<br>
Different yet connected<br>
We'll leave a mark of unity<br>
As a living legacy
