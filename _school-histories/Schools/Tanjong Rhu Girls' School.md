#### **School History**
Established in 1950, Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School was located at Meyer Road. In the 1960s, Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School relocated to Tanjong Rhu Road, next to Tanjong Rhu Boys’ School.  
  
In 1984, Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School merged with Tanjong Rhu Integrated Primary School and Tanjong Rhu Boys’ School to form Tanjong Rhu Primary School. The amalgamated school was housed on the grounds of Tanjong Rhu Girls’ School and Tanjong Rhu Boys’ School. The building of Tanjong Rhu Integrated Primary School was leased out. Tanjong Rhu Primary School was eventually closed in 1989 to make way for Dunman High School, which continues to occupy the site till today.
