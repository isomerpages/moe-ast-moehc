#### **School History**
Established in 1999, Sembawang Secondary School is located at the bend of Sembawang Crescent, serving the needs of residents in the Sembawang estate. The school is currently in its 21st year of operations. It began operations with eight Secondary One classes of 320 students and 17 teachers.&nbsp;In 2001, the school was officially opened by former Minister for Education Dr Tony Tan.&nbsp;Sembawang Secondary School celebrated its 10th and 20th anniversary in 2008 and 2018 respectively.

Excelling in teaching and learning has always been the pride and pursuit of Sembawang Secondary School. TTo date, the school has had three recipients for the President Award for teachers: Mdm Norlita Bte Marsuki (2007), Mr Sulaiman Mohamed Yusof (2006) and Mr Edwin Chew Tec Heng (2005).&nbsp;

The school believes that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is an effective way of engaging its digital-native students. In 2007, the school was awarded the Lead ICT@Schools status for some of its forward-thinking initiatives to bring about more delightful learning, especially in the Science and Humanities subjects. In 2017, the school expanded its ICT initiative to ‘Programme to Empower Active Learning’ (PEARL), which focuses on one-to-one computing, to bring about more joyful learning opportunities for students.

Sembawang Secondary School sees students as leaders with latent potential.&nbsp;Its vision has always been centred on leadership development, ever ready to help them strive, serve and soar.&nbsp;In 2006, the school conceptualised the student leadership structure to ensure that all students are given opportunities to develop themselves. This enables students to strengthen personal leadership and to lead others in a more deliberate manner. IIn 2008, the school started the house system to provide further leadership opportunities for other segment of the student body. In 2009, the school started its Secondary Three Overseas Community Involvement Programme and Adventure Camp to nurture students to be more empathetic towards others on the global stage, while building bonds with their peers and teachers.

Riding on its strengths in digital media, Sembawang Secondary School launched its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Critical and Inventive Thinking in Media Literacy’, in 2015, and its Learning for Life Programme, ‘Developing Community Leaders through Values-in-Action and Outdoor Education’, in the following year.

Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever<br>
A pillar of strength in the north<br>
Great seat of knowledge and learning<br>
We give our very best with energy and zest<br>
Staunch hearts within each are burning<br>
To see our School strong and recognised<br>
As the Nation’s pride and joy<br>
It’s the fervent affirmation in each of us<br>
Every teacher, girl and boy<br>
Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever<br>
A blazing torch held aloft<br>
Warm flame of friendship and caring<br>
Lights every joyful day, in duties, work and play<br>
High hopes with each we are sharing<br>
To comfort those who are suffering<br>
As we spread abroad life’s love<br>
With such strength and dedication in all of us<br>
Alma mater soars above<br>
Strive, serve and soar<br>
As we march on with highest endeavour<br>
Striding forward heads held high<br>
Sembawang forever<br>
