#### **School History**
In 1977, Bedok View Primary School was the first primary school to be built in Bedok New Town, at the junction of New Upper Changi Road and Bedok South Avenue 3. Bedok View’s cohort was joined by students from Pin Ghee High School (Chai Chee) and Bedok Primary when the two schools closed in 1976 and 1996 respectively. The school was officially declared on 2 August 1978.

In January 2002, it merged with Bedok South Primary School to become Bedok Green Primary School.

Last Serving Principal:<br>
