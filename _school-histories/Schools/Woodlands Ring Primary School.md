#### **School Motto**
We Do Our Best

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/woodlandsringpri1.png">

The school crest shows the eagle, representing strength, confidence and swiftness in action, reflecting the importance of taking pride in the school’s work and ability to soar to new heights. The name of the&nbsp;school is inscribed in the ring above the school motto, ‘We Do Our Best’.

The three trees symbolise creativity, illustrated by the stylised representation of the letters ‘W’ and ‘R’, initials of the school. The trees also signify growth and the close collaboration of teachers, students and parents&nbsp;in moulding&nbsp;the future of the nation. The horizon symbolises vision, looking ahead towards a bright future, while the open book and the ring represent the desire to be learners for life and an all-rounded education, respectively.

The colours,&nbsp;white, blue and green reflect honesty, harmony and vitality, respectively.

#### **School Song**

It all begins at Woodlands Ring<br>
A thinking school that guides within<br>
Learning nation we will be<br>

For nation and Woodlands Ring
