#### **School Motto**
Challenge The Limits

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/farrerparkpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The open book represents the key to knowledge and learning.<br>
The growing plant depicts a child upholding the school's spirit of creativity, courage and flexibility.<br>
The three leaves represent the School, Parent and Community.<br>
Together they remind us that education is an on-going process, best maximized through the partnership.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Verse 1<br>
Like a plant,<br>
We will grow<br>
Blossoming each day<br>
We will do our best in every way.<br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard

(Chorus)<br>
We’ll strive for excellence,<br>
Integrity and honesty<br>
Here at Farrer Park Primary<br>
We’re challenged to be<br>
The someone we are proud to call me

Verse 2<br>
We will care<br>
We will share<br>
Helping those in need<br>
We will do our best in every deed<br>
We can be who we want to be<br>
By working hard

(Chorus)<br>
Here at Farrer Park Primary
