#### **School History**
Pioneer Primary School started in January 1995, sharing the premises of Juying Primary School. Juying Primary took the morning session, while Pioneer Primary functioned in the afternoon session. On 16 April 1995, the school officially moved into the current premises at 23 Jurong West Street 81.

In 2007, under PRIME, the school moved temporarily to a holding site at Jurong East. Pioneer Primary School returned to its upgraded building at the end of 2008.

In 2013, Pioneer Primary School became single-session. In the same year, with the school’s track record of a robust dance education, dance emerged as a niche and the school was awarded the Niche Status in Graciousness and Fitness through Dance. In 2016, ‘Graciousness and Fitness through Dance’ became a Learning for Life Programme in the school, aiming to reach out to all students so that they would develop an appreciation for dance and the arts, ethnic and cultural dance forms, as well as modern dance, throughout the six years in school. In 2019, the school was awarded the ALP status for the 21CC Project Work which has an interdisciplinary pedagogical tool for the development of Critical and Inventive Thinking, Communication, Collaboration and Information skills. It is aimed at sparking curiosity and building confidence in our students, to develop the intrinsic motivation to learn, and the ability to collaborate with others and develop empathy towards others. Threading through P1 to P6 21CC PW, students are guided by framing of questions using thinking routines and adopting the Paul’s Wheel of Reasoning to deepen thinking skills.

In 2015, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of community activities.
