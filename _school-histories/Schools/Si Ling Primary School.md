#### **School History**
Built on what was formerly a rubber plantation at the junction of Admiralty Road and Marsiling Lane, Si Ling Primary School was established in January 1980. It was officially opened on 28 August 1981.

On 8 December 2001, Si Ling Primary School embarked on a new chapter in its history when it relocated to its current site, 61 Woodlands Avenue 1. The move was part of the Ministry of Education’s PRIME project. The new building had better facilities and more space. With the upgraded facilities, the school is better able to develop the students and equip them with skills to meet challenges ahead and future-ready.

Si Ling Primary School aims to educate every student to work hard and give his/her best at work and play. It seeks to instill in every student the’ Si Ling SPIRIT’: Solidarity, Perseverance, Integrity, Respect and care, Innovation and Teamwork. The school policy reflects the ideals in the desired outcomes of education and translates them into practical steps that each child may apply in his/her quest for excellence.

The school’s mission is to nurture its students to be thinking learners and gracious citizens, moulding them to be future leaders of the nation. Si Ling Primary School continues to develop quality teaching professionals in order for them to help students realise their fullest potential.

Over the years, the school has taken on the role of moulding its students to become useful citizens of Singapore, who will able to find their niche in society. This would not have been possible without the hard work of teachers and support from parents.
