#### **School History**
Jubilee Primary School was established in 1967. The school was an **integrated** school, whereby students could choose from either the English or Malay stream as the language of instruction.  
  
In 1983, Jubilee Primary School took in pupils from Jubilee Malay School, which closed in the same year.  
  
In 1996, Jubilee Primary School closed and merged with Qifa Primary School.
