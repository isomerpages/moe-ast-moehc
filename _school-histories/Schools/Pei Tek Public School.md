#### **School History**
Established in 1946, Pei Tek School was a Chinese-medium school. As its student population grew tremendously between 1958 and 1969, the school shifted to a larger campus along Jurong Road.  
  
However, enrolment declined over time due to the growing demand for English-medium schools. In 1976, there were 281 students enrolled but not enough Primary One students to form a class. The school eventually closed in 1981.
