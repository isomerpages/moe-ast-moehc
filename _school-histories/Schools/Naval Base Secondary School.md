#### **School History**
Established in 1957, Naval Base Secondary School (NBSS) started as a full school known as Naval Base School on Bah Tan Road, offering education to the children of the British naval base employees. Naval Base School was the only full government English-medium school back then. In 1968, Naval Base School became a secondary school when the primary section was transferred to Canberra School. 

In 1988, NBSS relocated to its present premises on Yishun Ring Road. In 2000, the school became single session. In 2007, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary.  Two years later, Naval Base Secondary School completed its PRIME upgrading.

In 2012, NBSS gained niche status in visual arts. In 2014, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in art. The ALP is rooted in the school’s belief in the transformative power of art and its ability to expand students’ perceptions of the world around them as well as the potential for self-discovery and expression. In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in character education through sports. The LLP is anchored on the belief that sports provide an authentic platform for character development. The LLP promotes active living where students enjoy and engage in movement activities and develop a solid foundation for a balanced lifestyle. In 2015, NBSS began offering the Enhanced Art Programme.

The school’s ALP and LLP are testament of the school’s commitment to the holistic development of students. In 2017, NBSS celebrated its 60th anniversary.

#### **School Motto**

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/navalbasesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The lion represents Singapore. It exhorts one to take pride in the national identity, have a sense of belonging to Singapore and be committed to nation-building. The lion also symbolises bravery (strength in character) and courage (strength of the mind). The open book symbolises the importance of a good education and the constant pursuit of knowledge to achieve success. The four yellow lines represent the four ethnic groups in Singapore working and living together in harmony. The blue background shows the school’s commitment to integrate new citizens, as it values Singapore’s sociocultural diversity and promotes social cohesion and harmony. The three rings are inspired by the Olympics, and they represent excellence in both performance and moral character.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

We are proud to belong to Naval Base School<br>
We shall always cherish its name<br>
It shall warm our hearts though we be far away<br>
And shall stir our blood until our dying day

CHORUS:<br>
Hooray hooray hooray, let’s yell<br>
Three cheers for Naval Base School

Many a time in the past we were wrought with care<br>
We had plunged to the depths of despair<br>
Then the name of our school rang out loud and clear<br>
And at once we rejoiced and lost our fear

CHORUS:<br>
Hooray hooray hooray, let’s yell<br>
Three cheers for Naval Base School

Come what may to us in the days ahead<br>
Be they filled with pleasure or pain<br>
We’ll not flinch one bit under stress or strain<br>
But we’ll face the future singing this refrain

FINAL CHORUS:<br>
Stout hearts, brave deeds, great thoughts recall<br>
Proud mem’ries of Naval Base School
