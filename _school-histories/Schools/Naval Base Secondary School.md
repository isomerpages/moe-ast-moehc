#### **School History**

Whitley Secondary School was established on 4 January 1965, one of the few schools in Singapore that shares the same ‘birth year’ as the nation. Over the decades, the school has nurtured generations of sportsmen and civic-minded citizens who contribute with great distinction in industry, community and public service. Originally located at the junction of Whitley and Dunearn roads, the school shifted to its present site in Bishan New Town in 1992. The campus underwent redevelopment from 2006 to 2007, during which time the school was temporarily located at Toa Payoh Lorong 1.

Whitley Secondary School’s vision of ‘A Caring and Learning Community of Leaders’ has been the driving force behind its focus on developing students to their fullest potential so that they are able to serve the community, anchored in the school values of Perseverance, Respect, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy. The school is committed to delivering a holistic and engaging curriculum that develops future-ready learners who lead, serve and achieve. This is done through an assortment of strategies and programmes, focused on building a strong foundation for academic success, nurturing their leadership skills and allowing students to pursue their interests and strengths.

The school also actively seeks out meaningful and relevant partnerships to support and provide students with a broad array of opportunities to discover their passions. Whitley Secondary has two distinctive programmes: ‘Communicative Arts’ and ‘Active Citizenship for Social Change’.

‘Communicative Arts’, the school’s Applied Learning Programme, helps students improve their communication skills through platforms such as drama, conducting interviews and talk shows, public speaking and debates. It aims to nurture confident and self-directed learners who are able to apply their information and communication competencies effectively in their life and future careers.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Active Citizenship for Social Change’, is designed to expose and engage students in various social issues, and to promote empowerment and a sense of community among students. It aims to positively impact community issues by fostering empathy and nurturing a spirit of active participation in students.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/navalbasesec1.png">

The lion embodies Singapore. It exhorts one to take pride in the national identity, have a sense of belonging to Singapore and be committed to nation-building. The lion also symbolises bravery (strength in character) and courage (strength of the mind). The open book symbolises the importance of a good education and the constant pursuit of knowledge to achieve success. The four yellow lines represent the four ethnic groups in Singapore working and living together in harmony. The blue background shows the school’s commitment to integrate new citizens, as it values Singapore’s sociocultural diversity and promotes social cohesion and harmony. The three rings are inspired by the Olympics, and they represent excellence in both performance and moral character, which translates to academic excellence and in the school’s distinct programmes such as the Sports and the Arts

We are proud to belong to Naval Base School<br>
We shall always cherish its name<br>
It shall warm our hearts though we be far away<br>
And shall stir our blood until our dying day

CHORUS:<br>
Hooray hooray hooray, let’s yell<br>
Three cheers for Naval Base School

Many a time in the past we were wrought with care<br>
We had plunged to the depths of despair<br>
Then the name of our school rang out loud and clear<br>
And at once we rejoiced and lost our fear

CHORUS:<br>
Hooray hooray hooray, let’s yell<br>
Three cheers for Naval Base School

Come what may to us in the days ahead<br>
Be they filled with pleasure or pain<br>
We’ll not flinch one bit under stress or strain<br>
But we’ll face the future singing this refrain

FINAL CHORUS:<br>
Stout hearts, brave deeds, great thoughts recall<br>
Proud mem’ries of Naval Base School
