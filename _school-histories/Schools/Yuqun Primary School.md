#### **School History**
Yuqun Primary School was formerly a village school known as Joo Koon Public School, which began in the 1930s at Jurong Road, with an enrolment of 14 pupils. In 1941, it moved to a new, larger building but ceased classes the following year as the building was destroyed during the Japanese Occupation. After the war, the school was rebuilt and in the mid-1950s, it became a government-aided school.

In 1984, MOE re-built the school to honour the pioneers, and the school name “Joo Koon” was converted into the hanyu pinyin form, “Yuqun”.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Yuqun Primary School was formerly established on 3 January 1984 with 473 students in 15 classes. It was an English-medium school. In its first term, Yuqun Primary held classes for its students at Yuhua and Fuhua Primary Schools. On 19 March 1984, Yuqun Primary moved into its own building along Jurong East Street 24. The school was officially declared open on 5 September 1986.

Yuqun Primary had an extensive reading programme. Students were encouraged to donate books to the school’s Open Library, whereby books, magazines and newspapers were placed along the corridors and at the tuckshop for reading enjoyment. In 1986, the school introduced Project READ (Reading for Enjoyment And Development of the mind) to inculcate the reading habit among students. In 1987, the school introduced REAP (Reading and English Acquisition Programme) to strengthen the language and reading skills of its lower primary students. In 1989, Yuqun Primary introduced Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (USSR) to encourage students to read extensively.

From July 1987, Yuqun Primary published a regular newsletter.

In 2002, Yuqun Primary School merged with Yuhua Primary School.&nbsp;
