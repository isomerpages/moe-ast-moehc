#### **School History**
Tai Cheong School was started in 1938 by Chinese immigrants, and was named after its founding principal, Mr Chew Tai Cheong. The school stopped operations briefly during the Japanese Occupation and resumed after the Japanese had surrendered.

With the help of a member of Parliament, Mr Cao Yu Ying, a plot of land was identified on a small hilltop, and in 1973, Tai Cheong school reopened with 12 classrooms. In 1977, Tai Cheong Public School moved to its new building at Track 7 Chua Chu Kang Road and was officially declared open by Mr Chai Chong Yii, the Senior Minister of State for Education. The school played a pivotal role in promoting the spirit of togetherness \[‘Gotong Royong’\] in the community. On 1 April 1983, the school converted its status from a Chinese village school to an English-medium government school. In 1989, Chua Chu Kang Primary School merged with Dazhong Primary. A new CCKPS was established in 1994 for children in the Chua Chu Kang area. The school was temporarily relocated from 2009 to 2010 during the PRIME upgrading, and returned to its Bukit Batok premises in December 2011. In 2014, Dazhong Primary School became the first school in Singapore to have a Ministry of Education kindergarten co-sited within its premises. The school also had its official opening ceremony on 1 August 2014.

Arts Education Programme@Dazhong is Dazhong Primary’s Learning for Life Programme since 2014. It aims to develop 21st-century competencies in students and prepare them to be future-ready. The school’s Junior Orchestra Talent Development programme is supported by the Ministry of Education’s Arts Education Branch.
