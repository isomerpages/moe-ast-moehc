The school crest comprises of&nbsp;**a star,&nbsp;a globe,&nbsp;the constellation&nbsp;and&nbsp;a pair of wings**.

**The star**&nbsp;symbolizes our belief that every child can realise his or her potential to shine brightly, and we aspire to bring out the star quality in each of them.

**The globe**&nbsp;represents the important part our students can play in the global and local communities.

**The constellation**&nbsp;represents our journey of lifelong learning and construction of new knowledge.

**The pair of wings**&nbsp;symbolizes the school soaring to greater heights, in search of higher aspirations and excellence.

Our motto ‘Aspire and Achieve’ urges teachers and students to be anchored on strong moral values, set their sights high, and strive towards a common goal.

The pillar with the core values, ‘TGPS’, represents our effort in achieving our aspirations.&nbsp; Our core values are&nbsp;**T**eam Spirit,&nbsp;**G**raciousness,&nbsp;**P**erseverance and&nbsp;**S**elf-Discipline.

Setting our sights high<br>
Expanding our potential<br>
Reaching for the sky

(Chorus)
