The school crest conjures up a conducive environment, in which its students are engaged and challenged in their learning. The encompassing circles represent a wholesome environment instrumental to the holistic development of its students in the cognitive, moral, aesthetics, physical and social domains.

The rising sun signifies vibrancy and passion in learning. The fluidity of water symbolises adaptability and emphasises the importance of character building. Anchoring on skills and values, its students will thrive in a volatile world.

The hardy palm tree embodies the dispositions of resilience. Staying steadfast in realising the school’s vision and mission, the school community is committed to taking Oasis Primary School to greater heights with confidence.
