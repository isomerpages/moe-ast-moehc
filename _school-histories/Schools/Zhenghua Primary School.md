#### **School History**
Zhenghua Primary School was established in 1989 with a student population of 560 and a teaching staff of 28. The school was formed following the closure of the former Cheng Hwa Public School in 1985 after 44 years.

The school was housed temporarily at Keming Primary School before it moved to its current premises at Fajar Road on 30 November 1989. From 2005-2006, the school underwent PRIME upgrading, which added new facilities to deliver quality education to its students. The school started its PERI+ Upgrading in 2019 and the upgrading is expected to be completed by the end of 2020.&nbsp; Following its completion, the school will have an Indoor Sports Hall, outdoor fitness area and outdoor education trail, a Performing Arts Studio, Dance Studio and Band Room. The MOE Kindergarten@Zhenghua and K-Care will also begin to take in their first cohort of pre-school students at the start of 2021.

The school celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2019. &nbsp;Over the years, what has been distinctive and enduring about the school are our caring culture, the excellent teamwork of committed staff, our strengths in the creative arts and our vibrant learning environment with opportunities for students to develop their interests and talents.

We offer a student-centric, values-driven education that nurtures the whole child and prepares our students for life and lifelong learning. We seek to develop leaders of character, critical and creative thinkers and lifelong learners who are able to give back to the society and make a difference. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) – Aesthetics Appreciation through Dance Arts Education – provides students with opportunities to experience quality arts programmes and develop their creative voice through the creative arts.&nbsp; In 2020, the school embarked on its Applied Learning Programme (ALP) – Advocates and Innovators for Sustainable Living.&nbsp; An important platform for values-in-action, student agency and the development of 21st&nbsp;century competencies, the school’s ALP involves students in interdisciplinary, inquiry-based learning, design thinking and value creation to address problems related to sustainable living in authentic contexts in collaboration with community partners.

Over the years, Zhenghua’s students have graduated to further education and have developed lifelong skills in the physical, intellectual, emotional and social domains. They have become useful, productive and contributing citizens of the nation. All these achievements bear testimony to the school motto, ‘The Best That We Can Be’, and the school’s emphasis on the development of the whole child.

For Zhenghua we sing<br>

Of life we learn<br>
How to be strong<br>
To help our friends<br>
The best that we can

For knowledge we seek<br>
To quench our thirst<br>

With one voice we pledge<br>
Our motto forever<br>
The best that we can be
