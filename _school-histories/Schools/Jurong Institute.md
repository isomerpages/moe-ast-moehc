#### **School History**
Jurong Institute&nbsp;was formed in 1989 as Singapore’s third of four centralised institutes offering three-year pre-university courses leading to the Singapore Cambridge General Certificate of Education (GCE) “A” Level examinations. The inaugural campus was located at Jurong West Street 91.

On 18 November 1994, Jurong Institute relocated to 2 Toh Tuck Terrace. The school flag was lowered for the last time at Jurong West and the student councillors set off on a symbolic relay run, carrying a torch to signify that the JI spirit would continue to burn at the new premises. Lion dancers ushered staff and students into their new campus.

Jurong Institute aimed to provide an all-rounded education for its students and to develop them to the fullest by engaging them in a variety of programmes, both academic and non-academic. In 2000, the institute clinched a gold medal at the Singapore Youth Festival Drama Competition with their adaptation of Desmond Sim’s play,&nbsp;_Old Woman’s Dying, Old Woman’s Dead_.

In 2004, Jurong Institute merged with Outram Institute to become Millennia Institute.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/juronginstitute1.png">

The Jurong Institute crest is shaped like a&nbsp;**building**&nbsp;with an&nbsp;**open Gothic window**&nbsp;at the top. This signifies the strong foundation upon which the Institute is built and the opening of new windows in the minds of students as they stream forth from the Institute.

The&nbsp;**arrow**, formed by the initials J and I, is pointing upwards, and reflects the aspiration of progress through the years.

#### **School Song**
<small>*School song unavailable*</small>

J for Jurong, Justice too<br>
I for integrity<br>
Two ideals, two flags salute<br>
For nation and for Institute

**Chorus:**<br>
Open the window, open the mind<br>
Reach out to others and be kind<br>
Pledging to build society<br>
May JI forever be

We will give our very best<br>
Striving for excellence<br>
Strong in spirit, body, mind<br>
The truth of life we all must find

As through life we journey on<br>
JI spirit may we keep<br>
Serve the nation loyally<br>
With Justice and Integrity
