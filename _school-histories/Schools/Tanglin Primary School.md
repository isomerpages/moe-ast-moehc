#### **School History**
Tanglin Primary School was officially declared open on 29 September. Located at 367 Commonwealth Ave, the school was originally known as Tanglin Integrated Primary School. In the late 1970s, the name of the school was changed to Tanglin Primary School. Lessons at Tanglin Primary were taught in the English and Malay languages.

In 1984, the new school extension, comprising a two-storey hall and canteen, was completed. On 29 September 1984, Tanglin Primary celebrated its 20th anniversary.

In January 2002, Tanglin Primary School merged with Mei Chin Primary School to become Queenstown Primary School.

To play and work in harmony<br>
Where many races meet<br>
We help each other think, improve<br>
Progress and succeed<br>
Our deeds begin in thought<br>
Which becomes success.<br>
When we try to improve<br>
We shall progress<br>
We have courage with ambition<br>
And stamina for the test<br>
Brining honour to school and nation<br>
Giving of our best.
