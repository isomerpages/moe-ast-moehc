#### **School History**
Established in 1987, East View Secondary School began operations at Tampines Secondary School. In June that same year, East View Secondary School relocated to its own premises at 3 Tampines Street 42.    
  
For over three decades of its existence, East View has provided a holistic education to diverse students living in Tampines and the surrounding areas. In line with its student profile, the school and its staff are focused on developing each student to be a self-leader – one who is aware of his or her strengths and areas for improvement, and is able to manage oneself to achieve his or her personal best. Self-leadership also means the ability to manage relationships with others and maintain connection to the community, becoming a positive influence on those around the individual.   
  
The school’s key programmes are anchored on the school vision, school values and the GRIT (Growth Mindset, Resilience, Innovation and Tenacity) values. These are distilled into Character and Citizenship Education lessons through the ‘7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens’ and in every aspect of school life, from the academic, to co-curricular activities (CCAs) and other school activities.   
  
East View has created a strong culture based on care and excellence, striving to balance care for students, with setting high standards and expectations so that students grow up to be independent with self-leadership. CCAs and Educational and Career Guidance are integral parts of the East View experience and every student is expected to participate and achieve to the best of their abilities.  
  
The school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in community and youth leadership through service in 2014. The vibrant values-in-action programme takes a segmented approach by empowering students to plan and conceptualise activities that meet community needs and promote enduring learning. In 2015, East View was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘21st-century Innovators through Health Science’, which provides opportunities for all students to learn about health science through current and real-world issues. In turn, students apply what they have learnt to benefit the community.   
  
From January 2019, East View Secondary would be merged with East Spring Secondary School.
