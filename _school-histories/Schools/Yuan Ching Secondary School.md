#### **School History**
Yuan Ching Secondary School was established in 1978 as a government, co-educational English and Chinese integrated school. The school was officially opened on 28 August 1980 and quickly established itself nationally with achievements in basketball and cross-country.

In 1988, the school became an English-medium school. Between 1987 and 1990, the school also offered Arts and Commerce courses at the pre-university level. The school suffered falling enrolment in the late 1990s, but turned around in early 2000s with sustained value-added academic performance. The school was completely rebuilt on site from 2006 to 2009 under PRIME. In 2018, the school celebrated its 40th anniversary, and entered the Singapore Book of Records that same year with the most number of participants in a chain push-up.

Yuan Ching Secondary School offers the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Marine Robotics’ as part of the 'Future of Transportation' theme, and offers Direct School Admission for students keen to develop their passion and talent in Robotics. The school also offers the Learning for Life Programme, ‘gRowing Values Through Sports and Outdoor Experiences’.&nbsp;

The radiating sun formation represents the school as a place where the source of learning shines and energises a passion for lifelong learning and whole-child development. The colour orange represents the radiance from the sun, compassion and loyalty. The colour black represents steadfastness, strength and integrity. The colour yellow represents the resilience of youth, excellence and enterprise.
