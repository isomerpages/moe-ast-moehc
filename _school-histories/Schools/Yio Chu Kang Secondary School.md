#### **School History**
Yio Chu Kang Secondary School was established in 1965 due to the demand for secondary education for the children of residents in the area. The school started as an integrated English-Chinese stream school at 11 Milestone Yio Chu Kang Road and was officially declared open in June 1966.  

In 1982, the school moved into a new building along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 5, and adopted a new school logo. In 2000, the school was selected to be one of the first schools to benefit from PRIME upgrading. The campus was upgraded with more facilities, particularly for the performing arts.

In 2007, in recognition of the school’s tradition of excellence in the performing arts, it was awarded niche status in the performing arts. In the following year, the school hall was significantly upgraded and renamed The Performing Arts Theatre with the generous support of the Tan Ean Kiam Foundation.

In 2014, Yio Chu Kang Secondary established a satellite partnership with Pathlight School to create sustained and regular opportunities for the authentic social integration of students with different learning abilities.

In 2018, the school merged with Chong Boon Secondary, operating from the site of Yio Chu Kang Secondary School. To express the merged identity of the two schools, the new school adopted the English name ‘Yio Chu Kang Secondary School’ and took on the Chinese name of Chong Boon Secondary School, 崇文中学 (_Chong Wen Zhong Xue_). To mark the transformation, the school logo was reinterpreted. In 2019, a new school song was introduced to capture the aspirations and heritage of the two schools.

#### **School Motto**
Pursuit of Knowledge, Service to All

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/ycksec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The symmetry of the logo represents the balance of a holistic education for all. It features three orange shapes that resemble the bloom of petals. Collectively, they represent the school’s desire to nurture students to become competent learners, confident leaders and caring innovators.

The three segments also suggest seeds beginning to burst open with energy and life, expressing optimism in nurturing people and developing aspirations. They reflect the belief that an open mind and a willingness to seek new experiences ensures that students will learn, thrive and make a difference. In this way, the three seeds echo the keywords of the school motto: pursuit, knowledge, and service.

A strong letter ‘Y’ in the centre not only stands for the school name, but also suggests a tree trunk with branches pointing skyward in open embrace of learning and service to others.

The circle that brings all the elements together forms a neverending ring to symbolise the collaborative synergy of staff, students and the community working together in a spirit of inclusivity.
