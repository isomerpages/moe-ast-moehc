#### **School History**
Mountbatten Primary School was established in 1981 with the merger of two primary schools – Mountbatten English School and Mountbatten Government Chinese Primary School. The school was named after Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was the British Military Administrator of Malaya from 1945 to 1946.

Mountbatten Primary School did well at sports, in particular track and field, badminton, soccer, basketball and volleyball. The school consistently achieved the NAPFA Gold Award from 1994 to 2000, as well as the Sustained Achievement Award for commendable performance in the Trim and Fit (TAF) Programme from 1996 to 2000. In 2000, the school also achieved a Silver Award in the Central Judging of Primary School Choirs.

The school published a regular newsletter, _MPS Update_.

In January 2001, Mountbatten Primary School merged with Haig Boys’ Primary School and Fowlie Primary School to become Tanjong Katong Primary School.

#### **School Song**

Mountbatten School, Mountbatten School<br>
Proud are we of a wonderful school<br>
Children are we, learning to be<br>
Good and loyal for others to see

**Chorus:**<br>
Everyone join as one<br>
To march in the spirit of knowledge and truth<br>
We will all together do our very best<br>
To show forth Mountbatten School

Week by week, we’ll ever seek<br>
Progress in all our work and play<br>
All will say oh, what a day<br>
To learn is to live at Mountbatten School
