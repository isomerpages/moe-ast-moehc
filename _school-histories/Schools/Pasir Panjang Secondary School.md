<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Pasir Panjang Secondary School was established in 1955. The school shared
facilities with Alexandra Estate Secondary School before its own building
was ready for use during its first year of establishment.</p>
<p>In 1956, male students from Alexandra Estate Secondary School were transferred
to Pasir Panjang Secondary School, while the remaining female students
from Alexandra Estate Secondary School formed Crescent Girls’ School. Pasir
Panjang Secondary School remained an all-boys school until 1962. From 1962
till its closure in 1996, Pasir Panjang Secondary School was a co-ed school.</p>
<p>In 1987, Pasir Panjang Secondary School’s student enrolment fell to 575.
The continuous decline in enrolment figures led to its eventual closure
in 1996. The remaining students of Pasir Panjang Secondary School subsequently
joined Hua Yi Secondary School.</p>
<p>Following the school’s closure, the school premises were left vacant for
several years. In 2000, it was converted into the Ministry of Education
(MOE)’s Labrador Adventure Centre. This centre has remained at the former
site of the school till today.</p>
