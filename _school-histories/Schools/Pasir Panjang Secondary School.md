<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Pasir Panjang Secondary School was established in 1955. The school shared
facilities with Alexandra Estate Secondary School before its own building
was ready for use during its first year of establishment.</p>
<p>In 1956, male students from Alexandra Estate Secondary School were transferred
to Pasir Panjang Secondary School, while the remaining female students
from Alexandra Estate Secondary School formed Crescent Girls’ School. Pasir
Panjang Secondary School remained an all-boys school until 1962. From 1962
till its closure in 1996, Pasir Panjang Secondary School was a co-ed school.</p>
<p>In 1987, Pasir Panjang Secondary School’s student enrolment fell to 575.
The continuous decline in enrolment figures led to its eventual closure
in 1996. The remaining students of Pasir Panjang Secondary School subsequently
joined Hua Yi Secondary School.</p>
<p>Following the school’s closure, the school premises were left vacant for
several years. In 2000, it was converted into the Ministry of Education
(MOE)’s Labrador Adventure Centre. This centre has remained at the former
site of the school till today.</p>

<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>Our school crest/badge has 4 sections, each depicting a message. The sections
include an open book, a lion over a castle, 3 fishes in mid air and our
school motto.</p>
<p>The open book reminds us of the knowledge which our students seek within
the walls of PPSS.</p>
<p>The lion over the castle brings home the message of our country, the Lion
City. This is the reminder of the strength and courage of the nation of
which we are a part.</p>
<p>The 3 fishes are really Duyongs. These Duyongs once teemed the stretch
of water of Pasir Panjang. They are small but they are known to be able
to ride the forecast storms. What they lack in size, they make up in courage
and determination, a fitting symbol of industry for our students. The closing
lines of our school song reads:</p>
<p>“....And as the Duyong rides up storm, so shall we face</p>
<p>The future with zest and steadfast enterprise.”</p>
