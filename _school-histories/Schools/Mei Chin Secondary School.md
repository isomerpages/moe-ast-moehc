#### **School History**
In 1975, Mei Chin Secondary School was set up with 12 Secondary One classes. The school was temporarily located at Preston Road and under the administration of Henderson Secondary School.  By mid-1975, the pioneering students moved into the newly completed Henderson Secondary school building at Henderson Road.

In 1976, students from Mei Chin Secondary School moved to the new school premises in Mei Chin Road. 18 new Secondary One classes were added to the school population; a portion of the classes came from Henry Park School. It was a new milestone for Mei Chin Secondary School as the new uniform was designed, the school crest drawn up and the school motto established.

In the 1980s, the school had offered a wide range of extra-curricular activities. There were eight uniformed units, 13 societies and 12 games clubs in 1985. Mei Chin Secondary School also participated in inter-school Gardening and Landscaping Competitions and came out top honours in 1981 and 1982.

A key feature of the school is its “Tour & Outdoor Activities” programme where all students in the school would join outdoor activities such as tours to Malaysia, mountain climbing, hiking and camping. These whole school programmes allowed students to interact and relate with one another, developing their qualities of cooperation, perseverance and commitment.

In 1997, the school had 603 students in 22 classes, with a total of 38 teaching staff and 11 non-teaching staff.

Mei Chin Secondary School was closed in 1999 and its remaining students were transferred to Queensway Secondary School.

The former site of Mei Chin Secondary School was left vacant until 2004. From 2004 to 2018, Global Indian International School’s Queenstown campus occupied this site.

#### **School Motto**
Progress through Achievements

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/meichinsec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest embodies the initials of the school (MCSS). The letter ‘M’ is incorporated to become part of the design of an open book, with the pointed edge representing a pen nib. 

The remaining three letters are contained in the three rings which rest on the book.

The open book and pen signify the search for betterment through education. This education to be attained is symbolised by the three rings. Each ring reflects one aspect of a complete education: the moral, the physical and the intellectual.

#### **School Song**
Lyrics: Catherine Samuel<br>
Music: Cedric Collars<br>

A young generation we stand today.<br>
Proud of our school in every way.<br>
Loyal students we’ll strive to be,<br>
Love and honour we pledge sincerely.<br>
The challenges of each day we will face,<br>
Together we will set the pace.<br>
Progress through achievement we will show.<br>
Forward, Mei Chin, forward go.<br>
Each burden we will share, each joy we’ll cherish,<br>
Each friendship with our hearts we will always relish.<br>
Onward, ever onward, be our aim.<br>
Till we succeed to gain your fame.<br>
Humility, integrity hold our sway;<br>
And God guides us on our way this day.<br>
Progress through achievement we will show.<br>
Forward, Mei Chin, forward go.<br>
A young generation we stand today,<br>
Proud of our school in every way.<br>
Loyal students we’ll strive to be,<br>
Love and honour we pledge sincerely.
