#### **School History**
Bukit Merah Primary School was established in 1986 from the merger of Redhill School, Bukit Merah North School and Bukit Merah South School. Bukit Merah Primary School occupied the combined premises of its former three schools.  
  
In 1998, Bukit Merah Primary School merged with Alexandra Hill Primary School and shifted into the campus of the latter. The former site of Bukit Merah Primary School has since been used for Gan Eng Seng Primary School and Bukit Merah Secondary School.
