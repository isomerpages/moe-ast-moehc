#### **School Song**
All we want to do is give the best we can<br>
In studies or at play, we’ll give a helping hand<br>
And as students and teachers a team we’ll always be<br>
And together we’ll work in harmony

**Chorus:**<br>
T’is our aim and goal<br>
Our school’s name we’ll uphold<br>
Working as a team<br>
We will achieve our dreams<br>
Working towards our goal, and that is our aim<br>
Working for our school, and we’ll upload its name<br>
And as students and teachers a team we’ll always be<br>
And together we’ll work in harmony
