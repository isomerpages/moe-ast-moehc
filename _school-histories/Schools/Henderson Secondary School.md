#### **School History**
Established in 1974, Henderson Secondary School was located at Friendly Hill on Preston Road. The pioneer batch of 600 Secondary One students and 24 teachers was led by Henderson’s first principal, Mr Gan Kee Soon. To cater to the growing student population, the school moved to Henderson Road in 1976. The school song written by Michael Habib Sim, a Science and English teacher.

In 1994, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary and moved to temporary premises along Queensway Road as the campus on Henderson Road underwent rebuilding. The school marked its return to the renovated building by holding a homecoming walk in 1997, which saw the whole school participate in a symbolic walk from the holding site to the new campus. All four former principals and then principal Mrs Ho Woon Ho joined in the celebrations. The new school building was officially opened on 17 April 1999.

Henderson Secondary School had a strong presence in the community, with Hendersonians being involved in community-based events. Some notable events were&nbsp;_Matchbox: Students’ Public Art Exhibition_&nbsp;held at Utterly Art Gallery in 2003, and Tanjong Pagar Group Representation Constituency’s Body and Mind Sports Day in 2004. In 2006, it held&nbsp;_Tessellation: A Visual Arts Exhibition_&nbsp;at Bukit Merah Community Library, and hosted the Silver Talent Fair. In 2008, it organised&nbsp;_Tessellation 08: A Visual Art + Design &amp; Technology Exhibition_&nbsp;at the National Library Building.

In 2013, Henderson Secondary School was accorded niche status in developing inventive and critical thinkers through design and innovation. In the following year, the school launched its Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP). Its ALP, ‘Speed, Precision, Engineering and Elegance through Design Thinking (SPEED)’, helped students learn about science, technology, engineering and mathematics through design thinking. Its LLP, ‘Leading with HEARTS (Hendersonians Always Ready to Serve)’, focused on community and youth leadership, providing platforms for students to develop their leadership competencies. The programme aimed to nurture students to exercise self-leadership and serve others in the community.

In 2017, Henderson Secondary School merged with Bukit Merah Secondary School, taking on the latter’s name.

#### **School Motto**
Education for Life

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/hendersonsec1.png">

The school badge is in the shape of a shield. The open book signifies knowledge. On the left page of the book is a flaming torch representing passion for learning and improvement, and on the right, an upright figure signifying youth and life. Below the shield is the school motto, ‘Education for Life’ – a reminder to Hendersonians that education is not only for academic marks and grades, but also for equipping them with the aptitude to be better people for life.

When we hear the name Henderson<br>
We glow all over with pride.<br>
When we sing the Song of Henderson<br>
Our hearts and minds rejoice<br>
Now to Henderson we raise this song<br>
In tribute and in praise.<br>
For we hear your living spirit calling<br>
To excel in every way.<br>
Education for life we receive<br>
Prepares us for life ahead and to serve our Republic.<br>
You teach us to be courteous,<br>
Courageous, loyal, sound in body and mind.<br>
Henderson is like a flaming torch,<br>
We’ll keep it brightly ablaze<br>
So your wisdom and philosophy<br>
Will spread all over the place.
