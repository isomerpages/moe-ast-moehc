#### **School History**
Yusof Ishak Secondary School was established in 1965 as Jubilee Integrated Secondary School, offering secondary education in English and Malay streams. Commencing with 984 students and 37 teachers, the school was renamed as Yusof Ishak Secondary School in the following year. On 29 July 1966,&nbsp;Singapore’s founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, officiated at the opening of&nbsp;Yusof Ishak Secondary School at Jubilee Road.

The school was one of the forerunners in equipping students with information technology knowledge and competency by setting up a computer laboratory in as early as 1992. With a focus on delivering a holistic education and in raising student achievements, the school became the first to top the value-added ranking in both the Express and Normal streams in 1992.

In December 1998, the school moved to its present site at 11 Bukit Batok Street 25. The symbolic move took place on 14 November 1998 when students and staff walked 7 km from Jubilee Road to its new campus. The new school building was officially opened on 29 July 2000.

Yusof Ishak Secondary School’s vibrant performing arts programme was recognised as its niche in 2007. In 2014, Yusof Ishak Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Programme for Authentic Science Technology and Environmental Learning’ (PASTEL).

In 2015, the school celebrated its 50th anniversary in tandem with Singapore’s SG50 celebrations. Among the various activities to commemorate the event were the launch of the Presidents’ Trail, and the original play,&nbsp;_Newsman To Statesman_, which captures the life story of the first President Mr Yusof Bin Ishak. In the same year, Yusof Ishak Secondary School was recognised as a Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence. In following year, it was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘H2eArts in Tune Programme’ (History and Heritage through Arts and Music Programme). The school will be relocated to Punggol in 2021.

#### **School Song**

<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13lfn93PZaCBq2tZmcNvRXKB3lb4RU4PN/view?usp=share_link" target="_blank">**♫ Listen**</a>

We’ll strive and strain together<br>
To make our life anew<br>
We’ll build a better world tomorrow<br>
For the future’s in our hands

Although of different origins<br>
We’re still one family<br>
Through day and night<br>
Through thick and thin<br>
We will always brothers be

Chorus<br>
Merrily we sing, we sing merrily along<br>
As we wend our way<br>
Through tortuous paths<br>
Definitely we’ll, we will definitely build<br>
A better world<br>
A better world<br>
We’ll build a better world tomorrow
