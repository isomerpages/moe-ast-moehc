#### **School History**
Lianhua Primary School was founded in 1946 as a small village school known as Lian Wah Public School in the Bukit Timah area for students who had not attended school due to the Second World War. Lessons were conducted in temporary classrooms built on borrowed premises in the Chinese High School. In the years that followed, the board of directors raised funds to purchase a plot of land at Duchess Road to build a permanent school building. Lian Wah Library was set up in 1947 by the school’s board of directors to provide manpower and financial aid to the school.

In 1987, Lian Wah Public School became a government school and was renamed Lianhua Primary School. As the new school building was not ready then, Lianhua Primary School operated at Dazhong Primary School for a year before relocating to its present premises at Bukit Batok Street 52. The school was officially opened on 8 September 1990.

In 1999, Lianhua Primary School underwent PRIME upgrading, and the main block facing the road was demolished and replaced by a six-storey block. The upgrading was completed in 2002. From 2014 to 2017, the school underwent PERI upgrading.

In 2015, Lianhua Primary School merged with Hong Kah Primary School, and the merged school operated from the site of Lianhua Primary School at Bukit Batok Street 52. In 2016, the school celebrated its 70th anniversary.

Lianhua Primary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in ‘Values in Action through Sports’, and the Applied Learning Programme in ‘RITE@Lianhua (Robotics, Info-Technology Education)’.
