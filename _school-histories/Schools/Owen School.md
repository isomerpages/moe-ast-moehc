#### **School History**
Established in 1955, Owen School was located at the junction of Owen Road and Oxford Road.  
  
In 1988, Owen School closed. Its remaining students were absorbed by Cambridge Primary School. After several years, the building was converted into Cambridge International Hostel. The building was eventually demolished in 2015. Since then, the site remains unoccupied.

#### **School Song**
We the pupils of Owen<br>
Owen the exemplary<br>
Our school is like a family<br>
With brothers and sisters mine<br>
In sports in studies and in all<br>
Our motto is working together<br>
Onwards Owen working together<br>
Never forgetting our happy days<br>
As years go by the memories remain<br>
As you pass by this Owen road<br>
The happy school day’s memories pop up in our minds
