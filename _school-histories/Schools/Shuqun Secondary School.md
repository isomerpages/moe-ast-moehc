#### **School History**
Shuqun Secondary School was established as Tuan Cheng Public School in 1925, with both primary and secondary levels. In 1933, the school was renamed as Seh Chuan School after moving to Jalan Seh Chuan, off Jurong Kechil.

In 1958, to cope with the growing enrolment, the school became a government-aided school and was renamed Seh Chuan High School. The Chinese name ‘Shuqun’ (树群) was retained. Further fundraising between 1973 and 1975 saw the completion of a six-storey annex in 1977 which still stands today. In 1982, the school was converted into a government school in order to cope with the demands of increasing enrolment.

In 1985, the school adopted the hanyu pinyin name of ‘Shuqun’ to signify its transition to a government school. It moved to a site at Jurong East Street 21. In 1986, the primary school moved to a new campus in Jurong West, separating the two schools. In 2010, the school celebrated its 85th anniversary with a celebration dinner organised by both Shuqun Primary and Secondary schools, commemorating their joint heritage. By 2012, the campus had completed PRIME upgrading.

Throughout its history, the school developed programmes to cater to the needs of its students and the community. In 2009, it piloted Mobile Robotics as a subject in collaboration with the Institute of Technical Education. The Shuqun Personalisd Asynchronous Curriculum for Collaborative and Self-directed Learning introduced a blended model of teaching and learning enabled by the use of technology. Shuqun’s Applied Learning Programme is ‘COding, DEsign Thinking and Robotics’ (CODER), which introduces students to Scratch and Arduino programming.

The school also excelled in co-curricular activities as part of its emphasis on developing students with character. It ran the SE2RVE2 (Shuqunites Engage and Excel thRough Volleyball Exposure and Experience) programme to develop the students’ character through volleyball. In 2012, the ‘B’ Division boys’ team clinched the National Inter-School Volleyball Championship for the first time. Its Concert Band and National Police Cadet Corps also achieved top national awards over the years.

In 2017, the Ministry of Education announced the merger of Shuqun and Yuhua secondary schools. In the following year, the school organised a series of commemorative events to celebrate its 93 years of history. In 2019, the school merged with Yuhua Secondary School. The merged school operates on the site of Yuhua Secondary School.
