#### **School History**
Jalan Teck Whye Secondary School was established in 1966 as the second integrated secondary school in Singapore, providing education in English, Mandarin and Malay. During its early years, the school worked on building its identity and encouraged integration amongst students from different races and streams.

The school was renamed Teck Whye Secondary School in 1980, and leveraged on community-oriented student development and its dedicated staff to build the students’ character. During this period, more programmes were developed and the school’s infrastructure was improved to enhance the learning experience of its students.

In 2000, a new school uniform, school colours and crest were introduced, which now form part of the school’s signature look. In 2002, Teck Whye Secondary moved to new premises in Teck Whye Crescent. With a larger campus and better facilities, the school was ready to provide a values-driven education. It began offering a plethora of opportunities such as overseas trips, overseas aesthetics exposure, sports programmes and an innovative art and design curriculum to develop its students holistically.

In 2011, in response to the Student-Centric Values-Driven Education initiative and to ensure that students would develop deep values, a community-based values-in-action (VIA) programme was implemented, where students partnered the community to reach out to residents in need. Today, Teck Whyeans are initiating VIA programmes within the community through the Youth Volunteerism Project.

Curriculum innovation was further enhanced when staff members visited the Stanford d.school and Henry Ford Learning Institute in the United States to learn about design thinking, which was infused in the school’s Applied Learning Programme from 2010 onwards. Design thinking was also embedded in the school’s Project Work curriculum and Orchid Hybridisation Programme, and continues to be a key focus in the school’s Applied Learning Programme.

In 2016, the school celebrated its golden jubilee with the following key events: ArtSynergy ‘Museum of Memories’, a musical featuring the school’s performing arts groups; Appreciation Day, which officially launched the Heritage Corridor, Chill-Out Room and commemorative&nbsp;_Dendrobium_&nbsp;TWSS50 orchid; and the Alumni Homecoming, which brought together former students and colleagues from 1966 to 2016.

Today, Teck Whye Secondary School continues to focus on its mission of creating a community of future-ready learners who lead, serve and achieve.

#### **School Motto**
To Strive and Not to Yield

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/teckwhyesec1.png">

The open book symbolises continuous learning and lifelong knowledge. The stripes represent the diverse groups in society, which are unified by a common goal and purpose. The colour grey represents the long-lasting and strong bonds that bind society together.

The shield is a symbol of strength and resilience that withstands threats and challenges. The colour blue depicts the qualities of trustworthiness and commitment. Also the colour of open skies and vast seas, it reflects limitless possibilities and opportunities that are open to those who dare to explore.

The four-pointed star represents students anchored in the school values, who serve as points of influence and inspiration as they light up the lives of others around them. The colour yellow exudes optimism and energy, and carries the promise of a bright future.

The winner’s laurel is associated with champions and is a mark of honour and distinction. It symbolises the school’s quest for excellence and recognition of the different strengths and talents in students.

Now in our days of joyous youth<br>
We will strive in earnest search<br>
For wondrous gleams of truth and light

Like pioneers we'll set the pace<br>
For all who dare to follow close<br>
Uphold the codes of our national life

Readied for the calls of home and state<br>
We'll give forever our best to both<br>
We'll freely give what we have learned<br>
Within the walls of Teck Whye
