#### **School History**
The school was established in 1968 as a co-educational and integrated school with English and Malay as the medium of instruction.

The school was officially opened in 1969 and had an enrolment of 1,840 students and teaching staff of 84. Female students at Maju Secondary were allowed to wear uniform in either baju kurung or blouse.    
  
Maju Secondary School also had a technical and an academic stream. The school was used as a centralized workshop for students of Dunman Integrated School, Broadrick Secondary School, Yoke Eng School and Presbyterian schools as well as Maju Secondary School.   

In 1977, a French centre was set up in Maju Secondary School, offering French as an optional third language for the local students in Singapore. As the French centres were consolidated and centralised at Monk’s Hill Primary School, the French classes in Maju Secondary ceased in 1983.

The school merged with Broadrick Secondary in 1996 to form Broadrick Secondary.  
  
From 1996 to 2015, Maju Secondary School’s former school building at Dunman Road was used by Northlight School.

#### **School Song**
Forward Maju School forward<br>
For the summit of success we are destined<br>
Hand in hand, forward we surge<br>
Fearlessly and proudly we stand<br>
With devotion we’ll defend<br>
Our country and all our people<br>
With the burning realization<br>
Of loyal and useful citizens<br>
With hearts fully burning<br>
Maju shall guide all her students<br>
We will uphold the national hope<br>
Our school success we will earn<br>
Once forward, forever forward<br>
Relentlessly we seek the truth<br>
Ruggedly we will never weaken<br>
Boys and girls of the school<br>
Maju<br>
