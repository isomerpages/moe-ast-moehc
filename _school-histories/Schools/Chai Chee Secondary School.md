#### **School History**
Chai Chee Secondary School (CCSS) was originally known as Sennett Road Secondary School. The school opened on 4 January 1968 as an integrated school with both English- and Chinese-medium students. It started with an enrolment of 804 students, comprising students transferred from Geylang Vocational School and Changkat Changi Secondary School, as well as new students who had passed the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) in 1967. The school was officially opened on 22 May 1969.

In June 1970, Sennett Road Secondary School was renamed as Chai Chee Secondary School, and a new school plaque was unveiled to commemorate the occasion. By 1973, the enrolment had grown to about 2,500 students. This included 12 ‘floating classes’ housed in Siglap Malay School to cope with the unexpected increase in the number of students who had passed PSLE in 1972. The last batch of ‘floating class’ students were brought back to the main school in 1977. The musical activities of CCSS were also given a big boost in the 1970s, with its debut at the Singapore Youth Festival’s Music and Drama Section in 1970.

In the 2000s, the school launched a series of special school-wide projects focusing on character and values education. The school also organised various exchange programmes with schools in China, Japan, Brunei and Malaysia to enhance the students’ learning experiences. In 2004, ‘Project Spark’ was launched as part of the school’s efforts to develop a creative, innovative and enterprising culture in CCSS. In 2008, the school motto was changed from ‘To Be Strong, Reliable and Sure of Success’ (勇信必成) to ‘Challenged to Excel’.

CCSS merged with Bedok Town Secondary School in 2011, operating under the latter’s name.

**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

On the eastern shores of Singapore<br>
Stands Chai Chee Secondary School<br>
On the fields and in the classrooms<br>
We young of many races unite

We study and sport in every game<br>
To bring honour to her name<br>
We are proud to do the best we can<br>
As worthy citizens of Singapore

**Chorus**<br>
Then here's to CC double S<br>
The school of our happy youth<br>
May we live up to her motto<br>
To be strong, reliable and sure of success
