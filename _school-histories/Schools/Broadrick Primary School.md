#### **School History**
Established in 1967, Broadrick Primary School was located along Broadrick Road.  
  
The school was one of two primary schools selected to pilot a full-day school session in 1981. However, in 1983, the school went back to operating as a double session school. This was because there were insufficient teachers to handle the increased workload during a full-day school session.  
  
Over time, the number of students in the school declined. In 1987, there were only seven classes with a total of 150 students. The school closed due to falling enrolment in the same year. Since 1995, EtonHouse International School has occupied the former Broadrick Primary School site.  
  
Principals:<br>
\- Mr Thamboo Mahendran (1976-1987)
