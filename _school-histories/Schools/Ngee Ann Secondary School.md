#### **School History**
In 1991, the charitable organisation Ngee Ann Kongsi mooted the idea of starting Ngee Ann Secondary School, and the School Building Committee was formed in the following year. After several rounds of consultation with the Ministry of Education, it was decided that the school would be built in Tampines. The school began its operations in 1994 with 15 Secondary One classes and an enrolment of around 600 students. It was temporarily located at Springfield Secondary School. The school moved to its new premises in June 1994.

Ngee Ann Secondary held its official opening ceremony on 3 August 1996. Its first batch of students did well for the GCE O-Level Examinations in 1997. The school has since established a track record for academic excellence. It also performed well in many co-curricular activities, winning national awards since 1998.

In 2003, Ngee Ann Secondary was granted autonomous status by MOE. For its all-round development, the school received the School Distinction Award from 2004 to 2008. For its excellence in teaching and learning, it received the Best Practice Award in Teaching (2003–07, 2008–12). Having been assigned the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Information and Communication Technology in 2007, the school started its journey as a ‘Future School’, piloting many initiatives in educational technology. One-to-one computing was launched in 2011 to encourage active learning in the classroom. The school’s guiding tenet is to provide a future-oriented education to nurture students to be future-ready.

Having established a good learning environment in both academic and non-academic domains for students, in 2015, Ngee Ann Secondary attained the Ministry of Education Best Practice Award for five areas: character and citizenship; teaching and learning; partnership; staff well-being; and student all-round development.

Another key programme of the school is the Elective Art Programme, which was started in 2012, for a passionate group of art students. The programme takes the ‘contemporary meets traditional’ approach, which is supported by multiple pedagogical practices.

In 2019, Ngee Ann Secondary School celebrated its 25th anniversary.

#### **School Motto**
Righteousness and Courtesy

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/ngeeannsec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The emblem forms the Chinese character ‘义’, which means righteousness. The two hands signify the close cooperation between the school, the management board and the staff. The hexagon held by the two hands is a bee hive. It symbolises the excellent and industrious learning environment of the school. The book and rays symbolise that students studying under such a perfect environment will certainly attain a wealth of knowledge and develop an excellent moral character that will lead them to a bright future.
