#### **School History**
Hua Mien Primary School was established with the support of the local Chinese community in the rural Sembawang area in 1945. The original government-aided Hua Mien Primary School was located at Jalan Ulu Sembawang. After cultivating countless talents for 41 years, the old school was demolished to make way for development.

Huamin Primary School derived its name from Hua Mien Primary School. Huamin opened its doors in Yishun New Town in 1987, and classes were held in temporary premises at Northland Primary School in 1988. The school began operations at new premises located at Yishun Avenue 11 in 1989. It was officially opened on 22 November 1991. 

In 2007, Huamin became the Centre of Excellence for Visual Arts in the North 3 Cluster, and in 2014, visual arts was developed as a Learning for Life Programme. The programme seeks to develop skills such as teamwork, creativity and intercultural understanding. It inculcates a sense of global citizenship and responsibility to one another.

Huamin Primary School is recognised as the first UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network School in Singapore as of November 2014. This prestigious honour was given by the UNESCO HQ in Paris. It is an affirmation of the school’s efforts in encouraging the arts and culture, as well as in promoting and keeping the environment clean and green.

#### **School Motto**
“Aspire to Excel”

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/huaminpri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The letters ‘H’ and ‘M’, derived from ‘Huamin’, form a solid pyramid structure that signifies the school’s belief in providing its students with a strong foundation in basic skills for living and in bringing out the best in the students.

The design also looks like an ‘A’ from afar, which is to constantly remind the students to Aspire towards excellence in their own way. There is also a ‘+’ sign in the centre of the design which encourages the students to continuously add knowledge into their life.
