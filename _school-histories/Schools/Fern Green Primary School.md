We are the seedlings<br>
With potential for growth<br>
Together here in Fern Green<br>
A place we call our home

For we are taught to give it our best<br>
To be kind and to learn with zest<br>
Our school is the garden<br>
Where our wings can unfold

Chorus:<br>
We are bright<br>
We are bold<br>
Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old<br>
Serve with pride<br>
Serve with joy<br>
Bringing glory to our school

Learning is joyful and we will never ever stop<br>
We are bright<br>
We are bold<br>
Fern Green Primary School

(Repeat Chorus)<br>
We are bright<br>
We are bold<br>
Our Fern Green spirit won’t grow old<br>
Serve with pride<br>
Serve with joy<br>
Bringing glory to our school

Learning is joyful and we will never ever stop<br>
We are bright<br>
We are bold<br>
Fern Green Primary School

(Repeat Verse)
We are bright
We are bold
