<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School was established in 2000 with 16 staff
and 320 students. The school is committed to providing a holistic education
that meets the needs and aspirations of its students and their parents.</p>
<p>The school’s status as the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Music, which
was conferred in 2000, stems from its belief that music develops future-ready
competencies such as communication and collaboration. Fencing was offered
as a co-curricular activity in 2001. The school has since clinched the
gold and bronze medals in the First Minime Fencing Championships and attained
excellent results in various national fencing competitions. Pasir Ris Crest
also broadens students’ global perspectives through programmes such as
the Overseas Community Involvement Programme and its twinning programme
with Nan Hai Experimental Middle School in Guangdong, China, which launched
in 2006 and 2008 respectively.</p>
<p>The school’s emphasis on character and self-discipline as well as its
holistic approach to nurturing the whole child have led to strong academic
and co-curricular outcomes. There is also a sense of identity developed
among students and staff. Students identify with the phrase ‘Crestian Overcomers’,
which enjoins them to develop a mindset of positive self-belief and excellence
when seeking to realise their aspirations. Teachers and support staff work
together to develop students, guided by a culture of care. The school’s
bid to strengthen staff capacity enabled the school to attain the People
Developer Standard in 2003.</p>
<p>Efforts to equip students with values and competencies for the 21st century
are evident in the way the school programmes support its desired student
learning outcomes, which were developed in 2012. In 2014, the school was
accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), ‘Crestian Communicators
of the 21st Century’, and the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Nurturing Crestians
of Tomorrow through Music and the Performing Arts’. In 2018, the school
was selected to offer the Enhanced ALP in Mother Tongue Languages, which
seeks to groom students who are strong and talented in mother tongue languages
for relevant courses and careers in their post-secondary education and
workplace respectively.</p>

<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>Pursue and Realise Challenges</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>The school crest pays homage to the word ‘Crest’, which is part of the
school’s name due to its location on an elevated part of the Pasir Ris
neighbourhood. The definitions of ‘Crest’ – the highest part of the hill
and the top of a wave – symbolise the positions that the school aspires
for its students to aim towards, pursue and attain in all arenas of their
lives, in line with the school motto, ‘Pursue and Realise Challenges’.</p>

<h4><strong>School Song</strong></h4>
<p>Verse 1:</p>
<p>What we have is something special here</p>
<p>something so unique</p>
<p>What we have will last forever</p>
<p>The world will be at our feet</p>
<p>When you hold your hand right out to me</p>
<p>I see a glowing chance</p>
<p>Spark the burning flame inside of me</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>Show me the way, show me the signs</p>
<p>Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find</p>
<p>Find within myself, capacities to excel</p>
<p>Bring out the love, here in our hearts</p>
<p>Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way</p>
<p>Stand together, with the love we'll always share</p>
<p>Show me the way</p>
<p>Verse 2:</p>
<p>When you have your hopes around me</p>
<p>Showing that you care</p>
<p>I'm not afraid to make it happen</p>
<p>Knowing that you're there</p>
<p>Stars will rise and stars will shine</p>
<p>and memories will remain</p>
<p>It's a seed that grows within me everyday.</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>Show me the way, show me the signs</p>
<p>Give me the wisdom to believe in me and find</p>
<p>Find within myself, capacities to excel</p>
<p>Bring out the love, here in our hearts</p>
<p>Teach us to pass it on and always lead the way</p>
<p>Stand together, with the love we'll always share</p>
<p>Show me the way</p>
