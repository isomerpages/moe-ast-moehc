#### **School History**
Established in 2014, the construction of Alexandra Primary School had began in 2011. The school was designed to support the delivery of a holistic and forward-looking curriculum. It features a cluster concept for classrooms with project zones to facilitate collaboration and community-building; performance areas with a flexible band room, music rooms and a dance studio for arts education and expression; as well as a sports zone to promote students’ physical well-being. An outdoor play area built on the roof garden facilitates creative play. A Green Mark Platinum Award school, Alexandra Primary School has nature incorporated into its design in an organic way to enable students to learn in an enjoyable and vibrant environment.  
  
The school started with 210 Primary One students in seven classes. After taking into account the Ministry of Education’s R³ICH values as well as design thinking and cultural intelligence, the school’s HER³OIC (Harmony, Empathy, Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Optimism, Integrity and Creativity) values were established. The school’s seven classes were named after these values. The pioneer team of staff worked closely with stakeholders and the community to create a learning environment and experience that would contribute to the students’ growth and development.   
  
Taking inspiration from the school’s HER³OIC values, the Alexandra Primary School song was composed and arranged by the pioneer teachers and officially launched during the school’s Achievers’ Day in 2015.  
  
The school was officially opened on 1 July 2016. Themed “Everyday Superheroes”, the opening showcased to the stakeholders and community the students’ journey of growth during the first two years.  
  
Since then, the school has grown steadily to comprise six levels with an enrolment of 1,246 in 38 classes. Alexandra Primary School is determined to continue to focus on creating a caring, safe and stimulating school environment where each child can grow and glow. Guided by the school’s vision of each student being a “Reflective Learner, Empathic Designer and Inspiring Leader”, Alexandra Primary School endeavours to build in each child a strong foundation in literacy and numeracy, as well as to equip him/her with the attitude, values and skills to be future-ready and to engage the world while remaining rooted to Singapore.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/alexandrapri1.png" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
The triangle in the middle represents the letter “A” and resembles an eagle spreading its wings over the globe.  It reflects the school’s mission to prepare our students to be future-ready and to engage the world.  
  
The rays symbolise GLOW, which stands for **_G_** ood Character, **_L_** ove for Learning, **_O_** penness and towards **_W_** orld-readiness.

The three primary colours – Blue, Red and Yellow - represent the School Philosophy:<br>
\- Every child matters, is unique and has the potential to make a difference.<br>
\- Every staff member is an asset, has different strengths, and wants to contribute.<br>
\- Every parent and community partner is a valuable collaborator in nurturing the child to G.L.O.W.<br>
The ornate-shape shield is incorporated into the design to reflect the heritage of the area where the school is situated.

**Verse 1**<br>
The sky is our limit<br>
On eagles’ wings we will take flight<br>
With resilience and optimism<br>
We’ll soar to greater heights
  
**Chorus 1**<br>
Grow and glow to the best that we can be with integrity<br>
Striving towards a harmonious society.<br>
Alexandrians build a gracious community<br>
Let’s take the lead and be heroic

**Verse 2**<br>
Let’s care for one another<br>
With love, respect and empathy<br>
Be responsible citizens<br>
We too, can lead the way
  
**Chorus 2**<br>
Grow and glow to the best that we can be with creativity<br>
Striving towards a harmonious society.<br>
Alexandrians build a gracious community<br>
Let’s take the lead and be heroic
