#### **School History**
Hillgrove Secondary School (HGV) is a government co-educational secondary school in the Bukit Gombak constituency. Founded in 2001 with 277 students, it was established as the result of the vision of Mr Ang Mong Seng, then member of Parliament for Bukit Gombak. He wanted the constituency to have a full secondary school that would meet the demands of the residents in the area.

HGV operated from the premises of Yusof Ishak Secondary School from January 2001 to February 2002. The school moved to its current location at 10 Bukit Batok Street 52 on 2 February 2002 and was officially opened on 5 March 2004. By then, the school had an enrolment of 1,500 students and a staff strength of 90. In 2011, Hillgrove celebrated its 10th anniversary.

In 2013, HGV gained niche status in flight and aerospace (F&A). In the following year, F&A was repositioned as the Applied Learning Programme, which develops students’ understanding of the application of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the field of F&A. It heightens students’ awareness of careers in aviation and space industries as well as engages students in projects that develop competencies such as confidence in communication and critical thinking.

In 2015, HGV established its Learning for Life Programme in the arts. It focuses on nurturing Hillgrovians through the arts by providing platforms for them to articulate creative ideas effectively. The programme seeks to develop students’ understanding and appreciation of various art forms, as well as to inspire them to be arts enthusiasts and professionals.

HGV’s refreshed vision of ‘Reflective Learners, Caring Changemakers’ is the result of the school’s re-envisioning efforts in 2017 to better position itself to develop future-ready students who can ride the waves of change and disruption. The vision describes a community of other-centered individuals who can learn, unlearn and relearn. Grounded on the school philosophy of ‘P + C = S’ (Potential + Character = Success), HGV recognises that success comes in various forms. It is committed to imbuing in Hillgrovians a growth mindset and helping them discover their strengths and passions so that each student can chart his or her path to success.

The school culture is defined by four tenets: collaboration, affirmation, respect and excellence. These speak of the school’s desire to help one another be their best and stay united to soar as one.

#### **School Motto**
United We Soar

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/hillgrovesec1.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is set against a clear background. It is distinctively marked by a grove of trees with intertwined trunks, inspired by the name of the school. The interlinking of the trunks represents the active interactions between Hillgrove teachers and students. It also signifies the moral and spiritual support that students draw from one another. 

The slant at the base suggests that the trees have firm roots and stand tall on the slope of a hill. This is another reference to the school’s name. The large crown of 18 leaves in varying sizes represents healthy growth, which produces shelter and shade for those who seek it. The shared foliage signifies the common goal and unity that staff and students share. 

Set together, the design elements express the school’s desire to be a safe environment that encourages young people to grow in values and skills needed to face life’s challenges.

With tender care<br>
Our seeds are sown<br>
To withstand the test of time<br>
Through loving nurture<br>
Our roots will grow<br>
With beauty we will shine<br>
Together we strive for greater heights<br>
With commitment we will triumph

The Hillgrove Spirit soars above<br>
Our flags fly high in honour<br>
Our beacon of light<br>
The loyalty we serve<br>
As Hillgrovians we uphold forever

With kindness and compassion<br>
Our friendships blossom<br>
To become bonds that endure<br>
Together as one, upright and sturdy<br>
We support each other in our quest<br>
We stand united firm and strong<br>
To Hillgrove our hearts belong
