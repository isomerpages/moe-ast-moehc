#### **School History**
Xianglin Primary School was established in 1985 following the merger of Tanglin Girls’ School and Kay Siang Primary School. The school was located along Tanglin Road  and occupied the combined premises of Tanglin Girls’ School and Kay Siang Primary School, which were located next to each other.  
  
In 1987, Xianglin Primary School merged with Belvedere Primary School. The new school was named Belvedere Primary School and was located in Xianglin Primary School's building. In 1990, following the closure of Belvedere Primary School, this building was demolished. Subsequently, office buildings were built on the site. Currently, the site hosts the Singapore Environment Council, Executive Counselling & Training Academy and Stanford Academy.
