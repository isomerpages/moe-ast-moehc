#### **School History**
Established in 1968, Bukit Merah Secondary School was the 101st school built by the government. It initially operated as a school offering classes in both English and Chinese mediums of instruction at 10 Lengkok Bahru. In 1984, Bukit Merah Secondary School became a solely English-medium school.

In 2001, the school relocated to a temporary holding site at 10 Raeburn Park, and shifted back to Lengkok Bahru in March 2003. That same year, after the completion of PRIME upgrading, the school went through three mergers: with Saint Thomas Secondary School in 2001; with Delta Secondary School in 2004; and with Henderson Secondary School in 2017. Throughout all mergers, the school continued to operate from its Lengkok Bahru premises. In 2018, Bukit Merah Secondary School celebrated its 50th anniversary.

Bukit Merah Secondary School is recognised for its niche in floorball. In 2017, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Character Development and Leadership through Sports’. The programme provides multiple platforms for Merahans to enrich their character growth and hone their leadership competencies via experiences within and beyond the school curriculum. In the same year, the school was accorded the Applied Learning Programme, ‘Creative Robotics and Engineering’, which infuses design thinking methodology and problem-based learning. It aims to ignite the inventiveness of students and develop their critical-thinking skills.

#### **School Motto**
_SEDIA_&nbsp;– Always be Prepared

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/bukitmerahsec1.jpg">

The school crest is a red triangle representing a hill of red laterite – Redhill, or Bukit Merah in Malay, the school name. The insignia ‘bm’ stands for ‘Bukit Merah’. The flash, which incorporates the school motto ‘SEDIA’, indicates progress, steadfastness and sureness of the path that one has to take to reach one’s goals, and the inculcation of values that prepares the students for life.

#### **School Song**

Youthful spirits are high and bright<br>
BMSS is known far and wide<br>
Tirelessly the teachers show the way<br>
So firm, so loving, so sure to inspire<br>
In school, no race nor creed that matters<br>
We mix, we play like brothers and sisters<br>
Wisdom, virtue, fortitude<br>
Must not be found lacking<br>
Our love for our country, constant, everlasting<br>
Drum up our courage and spirits<br>
Service to our community<br>
Be loyal to our country<br>
Be this our aim, be this our glory!
