#### **School History**
In 1945, Sin Min School was established to provide educational opportunities to the Hougang-Serangoon community. Eventually, the school became an English-medium school, and the primary section separated as a government primary school.

Later renamed as Xinmin Secondary School, it became the first neighbourhood school in Hougang to gain autonomous status and the Singapore Quality Class certification. Xinmin is recognised for its strong curriculum, holistic student development and youth leadership framework, as well as its innovative approaches to character development.

Xinmin prides itself on four signature programmes: XinminCares, Coding@Xinmin, RefleXions@Xinmin and Xinmin’s Student Leadership Academy. Each programme nurtures students into leaders of hearts and minds. True to Xinmin’s beginnings as a community school, XinminCares develops students into ever-ready contributors to the community and compassionate individuals with a heart to serve others at local and overseas platforms.&nbsp; Students also get to initiate and lead positive change, including organising the school’s annual Chinese New Year’s Spring-it-Up, befriending the elderly in Hougang, and organising Xinmin Change Initiator projects.

Xinmin aims to equip students well for the digital age by developing them into computational thinkers and conversant technology users who are also other-centred, empathetic and compassionate individuals. Coding@Xinmin exposes students to basic coding through active learning and tinkering, including animation and games creation. Above all, students learn to harness technology to improve lives, as they seek to impact society positively by designing solutions to authentic problems.

RefleXions@Xinmin is a lower-secondary drama programme. The purposeful play process develops students’ perspective-taking skills, empathy and critical thinking as they learn to evaluate the effectiveness of their performances and those that they watch.

Xinmin’s Student Leadership Academy comprises four developmental levels. The first level is offered to all students through leadership lessons embedded within the customised Character and Citizenship Education curriculum throughout the schooling years. Subsequent levels are offered to potential student leaders through their co-curricular activities, class committees or the Student Council. As Xinmin student leaders progress through their leadership journey, they apply the leadership skills acquired at various platforms, including school events management such as Xinathon Cross Country, Secondary One Orientation, All Staff Day and Open House. Senior student leaders who have undergone all four levels of development also organise leadership training for their juniors.

These signature programmes signal Xinmin’s commitment towards the total development of its students to become well-rounded individuals.
