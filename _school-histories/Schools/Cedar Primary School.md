#### **School History**
Cedar Girls’ and Cedar Boys’ schools opened in 1957, offering primary education to over 2,500 children. The two schools were merged in January 1985 to form a government co-educational school known as Cedar Primary School. 

Following PRIME upgrading, Cedar Primary moved into its current premises at Cedar Avenue in 2006.

In 2018, Cedar Primary School underwent another round of upgrading, which saw the addition of an indoor sports hall as well as an annex comprising classrooms and special rooms.

In the following year, Cedar Primary School merged with MacPherson Primary School, operating at the site of Cedar Primary and retaining its name.

#### **School Motto**
"Effort Determines Success"  
  
Our school motto, Effort Determines Success, encapsulates our belief that, when given equal opportunities, all of us can succeed with determination and hard work. Success is not dependent solely on the abilities or brains we are born with, because we can develop these abilities with the right attitude and effort. This belief compels us to continuously improve and innovate in the things we do.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/cedarpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The colour blue symbolises the sky and sea – infinite open spaces – which represent boundless opportunities for all Cedarians to explore their talents, interests and imagination. The colour white symbolises goodness and purity, reminding all Cedarians to always think, speak and act with kind intents. The shield signifies the school’s safe environment in which all Cedarians can learn and play. The five stars represent the school values: kindness, integrity, resilience, responsibility and creativity.

The school’s initials ‘CP’ take the form of a tree and the infinity sign, emphasising the belief that every Cedarian has infinite potential to grow and become better every day. The scroll-like banner, located near the base of the crest, stands for the belief that learning is the foundation for Cedarians’ growth. The scroll depicts the ideal that every Cedarian enjoys learning and expanding his or her knowledge of the world.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Cedarians with hopes and dreams<br>
We work and play respectfully in teams<br>
The efforts we make, the success we create<br>
The joy of learning, we will celebrate

**Chorus**<br>
We love our school, the place to be<br>
Where learning abounds for you and me<br>
Together we sing, our voices ring<br>
Cedar Primary, Our family

We learn and serve with humility<br>
With resilience, and integrity<br>
Creative and kind, we strive to be<br>
For our bright future, our responsibility.<br>
**Chorus**
