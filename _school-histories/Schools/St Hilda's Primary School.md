#### **School History**
In 1934, Anglican Archdeacon Graham White acquired Bethel English School on Ceylon Road to set up an Anglican school for girls. He named it St Hilda’s School, and captured the essence of the school’s aims and inspirations in the Mosaic command “Go Forward” (Exodus 14:15), which has since become the school motto. The school was officially opened on 8 May 1934.

St Hilda’s School was occupied by the Japanese during the Second World War. In 1945, it was the first private school to reopen after the war, with a staff of 20 and 615 pupils comprising mainly over-aged girls and boys. In 1948, St Hilda’s Afternoon School was started for over-aged students.

In 1950, the school was accorded grant-in-aid status by the colonial government and it became an all-girls’ school offering both primary and secondary education.

In mid-1980, plans were made for St Hilda’s School to relocate to Tampines as two schools – primary and secondary – due to the increasing demand for better facilities to meet the future needs of students. In 1990, St Hilda’s Primary School and St Hilda’s Secondary School were officially opened. Bishop Moses Tay consecrated the two schools on 22 January 1990. A few months later on 28 July 1990, the two schools were officially opened.

#### **School Motto**
Go Forward

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/sthildapri1.png">

The crest embodies the aims and aspirations of St Hilda’s Primary School. Its circular shape symbolises unity of its members in the midst of the diversity of people, creeds and cultures in Singapore.

At the centre of the badge is a cross mounted on a blue shield, which represents the teaching of Christ – to be of loving service to fellow men. The blue colour on the shield represents a forward movement through waters of uncertainty. The shield represents the perseverance of its members in their heavenly aspirations, which are grounded on earthly realism through education.

#### **School Song**

<a target="\_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-M23XwFSQvu3ePoOJkkuST3GBnEifLQd/view?usp=share_link">**♫ Listen**</a>

Go forward together one and all<br>
Forward, onward, whatever may befall,<br>
Let's raise our heads high and lift our voice<br>
Service to others is the Christian's choice!

Go forward, onward, over to the right<br>
In service and brotherhood and love<br>
Forward and upward, ever to the light<br>
Go forward and serve our Lord above!

St Hilda's our Alma Mater dear<br>
Go forward in her and have no fear<br>
She is our teacher, parent and friend<br>
Whate'er our path, wherever we wend!
