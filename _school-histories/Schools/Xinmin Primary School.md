#### **School History**

 Xinmin Primary School was established on 1 November 1945 by Mr Yap Fun Hong, Mr Heng Chin Soo and Mr Tan Choon Teng after the Second World War. It was then known as Sin Min School. Mr Yap Fun Hong had a dream to provide education for the needy children in the Hougang-Serangoon area. During those times, schools were limited and many children did not have a chance to attend school. Determined to turn his dream into a reality, Mr Yap sold his five pigs to rent three bungalows along Upper Serangoon Road to accommodate 620 needy students.

Sin Min School was one of the three Chinese schools at the time offering education solely at the primary level. In 1956, the school established the high school section, the first Chinese high school along Upper Serangoon Road.

In 1978, Sin Min School became a Chinese and English integrated school with the English stream in the primary school section. In the years that followed, the school became a government-aided school with primary and secondary classes. By 1980, the school had a population of 827 primary students, 762 secondary students and 63 teaching staff. In 1988, the school moved to its present location at 9 Hougang Avenue 8, and separated into Xinmin Primary School and Xinmin Secondary School.   

In 2015, the school became single-session after the completion of PERI upgrading. In 2018, the school has about 1,300 students and 120 teaching staff.

As of 2023, the school has 1317 students and 111 teaching staff.
