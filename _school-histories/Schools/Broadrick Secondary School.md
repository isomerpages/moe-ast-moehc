#### **School History**
Broadrick Secondary School was founded in 1968 at 2 Dunman Road. It started as an integrated school with students from the Chinese and English streams. In 1985, Broadrick became an English-medium school. In 2006, the school moved to the current premises at 61 Dakota Crescent.

The school has gone through three mergers: with Maju Secondary School in January 1996, with Telok Kurau Secondary School on 15 December 2010, and with MacPherson Secondary School in 2017. Despite these three mergers, Broadrick has continued to build on the rich heritage of the schools that came together.

In 2014, the school was accorded Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Service Learning through Community & Youth Leadership, and Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in A²CE (Aspire, Actualise, Contribute and Engage).

 In 2017, these two signature programmes were refined to ALP in Broadrick Entrepreneurship in STEM and LLP in Confidence And REsilence (CARE) though Aesthetics, Community and Youth Leadership. The ‘Broadrick Entrepreneurship in STEM’ seeks to nurture our students to become inquisitive leaders, critical and creative thinkers who embrace the spirit of creativity and enterprise. The ‘Confidence And REsilience (CARE) through Aesthetic, Community and Youth Leadership’ aims to mould our students to be future-ready learners with strength of character. Through exposure in the areas of aesthetics and service learning, they will experience deep introspection of self, and discover their passion and sense of purpose as they acquire new skills, interact with people and serve the community.

#### **School Motto**
Ready to Serve

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/broadricksec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Featuring the school colours, the school crest has a cogwheel in the centre. This symbolises the school’s continuous strive for progress and development as it undertakes its mission to educate, and this aim is represented by the open book. The torch represents the students’ commitment to lifelong learning. The four rings reflect the multiracial composition of the school community as it grows, learns and develop together as one united community. The concept of the school as a family is reinforced by the four intertwining rings.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

As youths with might and courage<br>
We will soar with honor and pride<br>
No matter what our race or tongue<br>
We're ready to serve in stride

We'll strive to achieve our goals and more<br>
With passion we prevail<br>
Remain gracious in thought and deed<br>
To victory we sail

Chorus:<br>
Unite as one Broadricians!<br>
We will aim to do our best<br>
Our torch burning bright with the spark we ignite<br>
Forging on with our heads held high
   
(Repeat Chorus)
