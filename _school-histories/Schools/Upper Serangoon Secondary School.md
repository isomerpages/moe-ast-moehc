#### **School Song**
This torch of learning, this store of skill<br>
With sweetness and light will the city fill<br>
From strength to strength we will always grow<br>
Knowledge and skill will make us glow

**Chorus**<br>
Upper Serangoon, Upper Serangoon,<br>
We always strive and never yield<br>
In classroom, hall or on the field<br>
Respect for all, malice to none<br>
In school and out, we all are one

We will jump and fight and race and run<br>
But all in friendship and in fun<br>
We will gladly try with all our heart<br>
Always to play the proper part

True and loyal we will always be<br>
To noble ideas of the free<br>
We will always stand with heads up high<br>
Reaching, reaching for the sky
