<img src="/images/bukithosweesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The top of the crest is a semi-circle with the name of the school in English on the circumference and in Chinese on the diameter. Within the semi-circle is the head of a torch, symbolic of education. After the semi-circle is the handle of the torch with a symbol of an athlete on its left to signify ‘Sportsmanship’ while on its right are two squares linked together to signify ‘Integration’. Below these is a book, the symbol of ‘Scholarship’. Then the School Motto in the National Language completes the crest.

#### **School Song**
On cindery ruins our school arose<br>
To serve the youth of Bukit Ho Swee<br>
A seat of learning long may it flourish<br>
Fostering love of knowledge true<br>
We love our school and sing its praise<br>
Our hearts uplift and glad voices raise.

Belagur Berhidmat is our motto<br>
We should constantly bear it in mind<br>
Cherish learning, treasure knowledge<br>
But more important is service to mankind<br>
Cherish learning, treasure knowledge<br>
But more important is service to mankind

In all we do we try to be true<br>
To high ideals and noble aims<br>
Our tasks we’ll perform with steadfast zeal<br>
From mental feats to sports and games<br>
Our duty we’ll never fail nor shirk<br>
The key to success is sheer hardwork
