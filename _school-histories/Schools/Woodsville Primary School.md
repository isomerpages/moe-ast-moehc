### **Woodsville Primary School**

#### **School History**
Woodsville Primary School was officially declared open on 9 March 1979. The school is located at the junction of Jalan Kolam Ayer and Aljunied Road.

In 1987, the school launched an “open library” programme to instill a sense of responsibility among its students and to foster goodwill among the teachers. This programme included a “free-wheeling” book system, where some 3,000 books were “littered” around the school campus, which students could borrow and retain for as long as they wished without going through any formal lending procedure.&nbsp;The school also had a “drop-in centre”, whereby children could read, play and receive counseling from teachers.

In 2002, Woodsville Primary School merged with MacPherson Primary School.

#### **School Song**
We belong to Woodsville Primary School<br>
We always obey the golden rules<br>
Early to bed and early to rise<br>
Off to school to learn to be wise

We appear well-groomed and neatly dressed<br>
All prepared to do our best<br>
With keen minds and eager hands<br>
We will work as hard as ants

To Woodsville, Woodsville here we come<br>
To the school that greets the rising sun<br>
Always prevail through perseverance<br>
Onward everyone
