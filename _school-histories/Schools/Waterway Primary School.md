The school crest shows the lighthouse as a symbol of direction for the school in the education of its students. The school aims to build strong foundations for the students to learn, to learn through life and to be gracious citizens. The tower is a pillar of strength and hope in a sea of change while the beacon is the light that shows the way.

We are here to learn, to lead, to serve<br>
The lighthouse to show the way<br>
For we are gracious citizens<br>
Here at Waterway Primary School<br>
We learn everyday. We grow everyday<br>
Our minds nurtured, Characters built<br>
For Work, For Life, For Future<br>
My Waterway Primary School<br>
We shall rise above our challenges<br>
We shall rise to uphold the name<br>
We will strive to do our very best<br>
Beacon of light to show the way<br>
The Tower, The Pillar of Our Strength<br>
Our hope in the sea of change<br>
We learn and strive to be the best<br>
My School, My Joy, My Pride<br>
And with grateful hearts we sing our praise<br>
And pledge ourselves to Waterway<br>
For Work, For Life, For Future<br>
Children of a better age<br>
We shall rise above our challenges<br>
We shall rise to uphold the name<br>
We will strive to do our very best<br>
Beacon of light to show the way<br>
To the Glory of Waterway we rise<br>
Viva la Vida Reaching for the skies
