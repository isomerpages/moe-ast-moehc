#### **School History**
Anthony Road Girls’ School was established in 1950.  
  
In late 1983, Anthony Road Girls’ School ceased operations. Subsequently, the former site of the school was used by St. Margaret’s Primary School between 1983 and 1986 when its own building underwent renovation. Then, Chao Yang Special School (now APSN - Association for Persons with Special Needs) took over the site in 1986. Since Chao Yang Special School’s move to a new site in Ang Mo Kio, the former site of Anthony Road Girls’ School has been occupied by the Ascott Centre for Excellence.
