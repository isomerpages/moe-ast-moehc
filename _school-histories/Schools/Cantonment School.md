#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Cantonment School was located at Cantonment Road. Cantonment School moved there, it was temporarily accommodated in Gan Eng Seng School before being relocated to Cantonment Road.  
  
In 1984, Cantonment School merged with its neighbour, Keppel School, to form Keppel Primary School. The newly amalgamated school was housed in the combined premises of the former two schools. When Keppel Primary School closed in 1996, the remaining students of the school were transferred to Zhangde Primary School.   
  
From 1996 to 2004, Keppel Primary School’s building was used as the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau office. The building was subsequently demolished. Since 2004, the former site of the school has been used for private business offices.

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Seow Peck Leng (1954-1958)
