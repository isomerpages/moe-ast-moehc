#### **School History**
NUS High School of Mathematics and Science was established by the Ministry of Education and the National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2005. As Singapore’s first and only specialised institution in math and science education, NUS High was afforded the freedom to design a bespoke curriculum that allows students to not just learn but also have the space to experiment, explore and discover their passions. State-of-the-art research facilities were set up in 2009 to develop and hone students’ research skills through the school’s Da Vinci Programme for research, innovation and enterprise.

A key emphasis of the school is to nurture well-rounded and self-directed students who are empowered to run their own programmes and events. In 2010, the students organised the first Sustainable Development Youth Convention, where local and international students convened to debate on responsible environmental stewardship.

In 2012, NUS High was appointed as the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Mathematics, and as the West Zone Centre of Excellence for Science and Research in the following year. As a leading institution in mathematics and science education, NUS High runs workshops for educators and students in Singapore.

In their desire to give back to their alma mater, the NUS High alumni conduct annual workshops known as Sprout, an initiative that started in 2015 to spread the spirit of lifelong learning to their juniors through interest-based workshops.

In 2017, about 400 stakeholders gathered to review the school’s accomplishments and chart its future directions. The fruitful gathering birthed its current vision, mission and school values. While staying true to its goal of nurturing mathematics and science talents in Singapore, NUS High’s vision is to develop pioneers, humanitarians and innovators. This has led to exciting new strategic initiatives such as the engagement of the school’s Parent Support Group, the NUS High MakerFest, which encourages innovation, and the successful pilot of Humanitarian Education to nurture the spirit of service in the students.

Since 2008, NUS High’s network of international partner schools has grown significantly with each successful run of the Singapore International Mathematics Challenge. NUS High leverages on these relationships to run distinctive overseas academic and student exchange programmes for its students. Through this network, NUS High has also helped to promote leading-edge education across the world.

Over the years, NUS High School has established itself as the forerunner in mathematics and science education in Singapore and beyond, and strives to exemplify the passion and joy of learning.

The school was officially declared open in 2007 and is currently located at 20 Clementi Avenue 1.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/nushighsch1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school logo underscores the importance placed on mathematics and the sciences. The test tube represents the sciences and the π symbol stands for the field of mathematics.

The third element, the sparkle, is emblematic of the dynamism and creativity arising from the synergy between these two disciplines. The colour green represents the nurturing environment that is instrumental for students’ development. The colour grey is symbolic of the solid base upon which the school is built.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

As the school flag flies up high<br>
Rising up toward the sky<br>
All our hearts rejoice singing in one voice<br>
For our spirit never dies

Burning passion deep inside<br>
With faith hope and foresight<br>
Scaling greater heights in one big stride<br>
For NUS High we fight<br>
Arise young minds together<br>
The seeds have just been planted<br>
In our souls the flames ignite<br>
As we show our might

Burning passion deep inside<br>
With faith hope and foresight<br>
Scaling greater heights in one big stride<br>
For NUS High we fight<br>
For NUS High we fight
