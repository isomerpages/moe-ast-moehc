#### **School History**
Westlake Primary School was established on 3 January 1977, with a total enrolment of 853 children in 21 classes. It was officially declared open on 26 May 1978.

The school placed strong emphasis on bilingualism and civic education. It had a distinctive mosaic wall mural, which was designed by Mr Ho Cheok Tin. Themed “The History Development of Singapore”, the mural was completed in 1979 and featured numerous landmarks of Singapore at the time, including the National Theatre.

In 2002, Westlake Primary School merged with San Shan Primary School to become First Toa Payoh Primary School.
