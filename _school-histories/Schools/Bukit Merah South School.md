#### **School History**
Bukit Merah South School was established in the 1950s.  
  
The school merged with Bukit Merah North School and Redhill Primary School to form Bukit Merah Primary School in 1986. Bukit Merah Primary School combined the premises of its former three schools.  
  
In 1998, Bukit Merah Primary School merged with Alexandra Hill Primary School and shifted into the campus of the latter. The former site of Bukit Merah Primary School has since been used for Gan Eng Seng Primary School and Bukit Merah Secondary School.
