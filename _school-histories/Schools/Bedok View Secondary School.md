#### **School History**
Established in 1977, Bedok View Secondary School (BV) was housed temporarily at Siglap Malay School. In January 1978, the school moved to its current premises at 6 Bedok South Avenue 3, and was officially opened on 28 September 1979 as the first government secondary school to be built in Bedok New Town.

In 2005, Bedok View Secondary School completed its PRIME upgrading. An Indoor Sports Hall and a synthetic soccer field were built. In 2015, Bedok View Secondary School was accorded the Learning for Life Programme, ‘Good Values @ BV’. Under the programme, the school focuses on providing opportunities for moral action and constant reflection to reinforce school values and social-emotional competencies through real-life experiential learning.

In the same year, the school was also accorded the Applied Learning Programme ‘Global Awareness for the 21st Century @ BV’. Through this programme, the school aims to connect academic learning to the real world. Using a structured two-tier experience, the programme deepens 21st-century competencies in students by nurturing critical thinkers with global awareness as well as confident communicators who can effectively engage with others.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/bedokviewsec1.jpg" style="width:23%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest features a lighthouse, which is the school symbol. The lighthouse represents the fire of passion and the guiding light to direct thoughts and actions. A strong and steadfast monument resting on a solid foundation, it is able to withstand the waves of changes and challenges. It also symbolises the aspiration to achieve high standards of integrity, strong character and resilience.

The school colours, blue and beige, are on the crest. Blue symbolises an endless quest for knowledge and character development, while beige represents determination and joy in achieving one’s dreams.
