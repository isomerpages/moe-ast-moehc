#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Set sail on a journey<br>
Hand in hand with you and me<br>
We care and share in harmony<br>
As one big family

Look forth to the future<br>
Be strong and persevere<br>
We’ll brave through the storm with hope and pride<br>
Let our dreams take flight

Chorus<br>
Mindfulness, Empathy and Care<br>
Values that we share<br>
Reach out to all, lend a helping hand<br>
To Serve To Lead, Punggol Cove<br>
