#### **School History**
Yumin Primary School’s history began with two Chinese village schools – Yook Kiau Public School on Tampines Road and Ping Min Public School on Upper Changi Road – which had been founded before the Second World War. Both schools were established by community leaders to provide primary education for children in Tampines. The two schools merged on 27 February 1974, and the resultant entity was renamed Yook Min Public School. In 1976, English-stream students from Telok Paku School were transferred to Yook Min when the former had to be demolished to make way for Singapore Changi Airport. Yook Min thus became an integrated school.

In 1985, the school relocated to its present site at Tampines Street 21, one of the first two government schools to open in Tampines New Town. It was renamed Yumin Primary School, the hanyu pinyin rendition of ‘Yook Min’. In 2003, the school was upgraded under PRIME. It celebrated its 25th and 40th anniversaries in 2005 and 2015, respectively. Yumin Primary School completed PERI upgrading and started its student care centre in 2017.
