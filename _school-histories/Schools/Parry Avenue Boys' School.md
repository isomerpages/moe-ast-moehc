<h4><strong>School History</strong></h4>
<p>Parry Avenue Boys’ School was established in the late 1950s. It was located
at Parry Avenue, close to Parry Avenue Girls' School and Parry Avenue Government
Chinese Middle School. In the 1960s, the school offered Tamil as a second
language alongside Chinese and Malay, making it one of the first English-stream
schools in Singapore to do so.</p>
<p>The school was one of ten schools in Singapore to receive a Certificate
of Merit in the 1968 Interschool Cleanliness Competition organised by the
Singapore Tourist Association (STA), which featured 517 participating schools.</p>
<p>In 1981, Parry Avenue Boys’ School merged with neighbouring Parry Avenue
Girls’ School and Parry Avenue Government Chinese Middle School to form
Parry Primary School.</p>
<p>Principals:</p>
<p>• Mr K. Kang</p>
