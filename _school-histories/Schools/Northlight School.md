#### **School History**
Established in 2006, NorthLight School is the first specialised school for students who have difficulties keeping up with mainstream education and are keen on vocational education. The school admits students who have attempted and failed the Primary School Leaving Examination at least once.

NorthLight School offers a three- or four-year programme leading to certification in the Institute of Technical Education Skills Certificate (ISC) and the Workplace Literacy and Numeracy programme. Students with sufficient English language proficiency can sit for the General Certificate of Education Normal (Technical) English paper.

The school received its first batch of students in January 2007. NorthLight School was temporarily located at the Geylang Serai campus and the Dunman Road campus during its inception. In June 2008, the Geylang Serai campus was closed and the last batch of students was transferred to the Dunman Road Campus.

In 2015, NorthLight School moved to its current location at 151 Towner Road. The school was officially declared open in 2016 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. In the same year, NorthLight Academy was set up to provide a work-study pathway for students who have graduated. The two-year NorthLight Academy programme incorporates school-based training and industrial attachments that lead to additional relevant certificates.

NorthLight School aims to provide an engaging education for youths and prepare them for lifelong learning and employability. Emphasis is given to nurturing the students’ socioemotional development by recognising their achievements, encouraging peer support, and creating conditions to promote self-esteem.

The school provides vocational training including industry attachments and pre-employment skills training to prepare students for the workforce. Foundation education is provided to strengthen students’ grasp of English, mathematics and information and communications technology. The school adopts an experiential approach in teaching and learning.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/northlightsch1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The letter ‘N’ is a navigational element borrowed from the compass to represent direction and guidance that the school aims to provide for its students. The five-pointed star is an iconic representation of the five values of Sincerity, Honesty, Innovation, Network and Excellence, or SHINE. Continuous learning and innovation are captured by the dynamic movement of the emerging star.

The white colour signifies the newly equipped student shining in a dark sky. It also conveys the sincerity and humanity of every student to learn at every stage of their life. The colour of ‘nightfall blue’ forms the backdrop and a contrast as the dark sky for the North Star to emerge brightly. The colour gray represents stability and professionalism.

Like the stars in the sky<br>
Shining bright day and night<br>
I do believe I have the strength<br>
To go the distance come what may

Innovations we create<br>
With a team that collaborates<br>
We will excel and do our part<br>
And embrace honesty to heart

Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
With love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and me

Every day we appreciate<br>
The lessons learnt and celebrate<br>
I do believe I can succeed<br>
Believe in my talents and my dreams

Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
with love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and me

Bridge:<br>
There may be times when things just don’t turn out right<br>
I do believe that I can make a change and shine out bright

Chorus:<br>
NorthLight we stand with pride<br>
With love and integrity<br>
We dare to strive<br>
For a better life<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and<br>
NorthLight I believe in you and me
