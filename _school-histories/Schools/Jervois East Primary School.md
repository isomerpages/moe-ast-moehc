#### **School History**
Established in 1957, Jervois East Primary School was located along Jervois Road, next to Jervois West Primary School. The school was originally established as Jervois East School I for the morning session and Jervois East School II for the afternoon session. In 1959, both sessions were merged under a single Principal.  
  
Enrolment numbers for Jervois East Primary School declined over time. By 1982, there were only 614 pupils. This was attributed to residents shifting to new towns.&nbsp;  
  
In 1986, Jervois East Primary School merged with Jervois West Primary School to form Jervois Primary School. The &nbsp;merged school was located on the Jervois East and West School campuses.&nbsp;  
  
Jervois Primary School closed &nbsp;in 1989 and &nbsp;the Singapore School for the Deaf occupied the building of Jervois East Primary School. However, the Singapore School for the Deaf at Jervois Road was later closed. The school building was subsequently torn down to make way for private housing.&nbsp;
