#### **School History**
Located at 1 Jurong West Street 73, Westwood Primary School was established in 2013. The following year, the school implemented its Learning for Life Programme in Community Service and Pupil Leadership. In the same year, it also set up its Parent Support Group. Westwood Primary was officially opened on 4 July 2015. In 2016, the Ministry of Education Kindergarten @ Westwood began operations.

Westwood Primary School focuses on nurturing the joy of learning so that every child can discover his/her interests, grow his/her passions, and love what he/she is doing. The school hence embarked on developing its Applied Learning Programme in Positive Design and Innovation, sowing the seeds for students to develop as future innovators and value creators.

In 2017, Westwood Primary’s whole-of-school approach to Holistic Assessment was showcased at the biannual Ministry of Education EXCEL Fest. It also clinched its first Ministry of Education Innergy Commendation Award for innovation in science teaching and learning. The school’s first overseas learning journey was organised, with 36 students and four staff members visiting Hong Kong and its partner schools.

Westwood Primary also further commemorated its fifth anniversary by breaking a Singapore Book of Records, for the largest number of handprints display. The first cohort of students graduated in 2018 – yet another significant milestone for Westwood Primary. Having grown into a full school, Westwood Primary set up a time capsule to mark historical dates during the its pioneering years.

#### **School Motto**
Future-ready, Anchor-steady

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/westwoodpri1.png">

The school crest shows a figure of a huge tree formed by six small trees, representing the six year levels within the school. It also symbolises how everyone is unique as individuals, yet united as a community.

The base trees in light green signify its passion for community. The middle trees is a reminder to always embrace a heart of gratitude and a resilient mindset. The tallest tree in dark green is a symbol for all to possess a future-ready confidence, to move together as one into the desired future. These are the four character strengths the school aspires to imbue in the students. The school crest aptly reflects the school’s motto, ‘Future-ready, Anchor-steady’. The school name is in teal and brown, which are contrasting colours of the giant redwood trees, representing its inspiration to thrive and be exceptional.

#### **School Song**


Boys and girls of Westwood primary<br>
we are destined to lead<br>
