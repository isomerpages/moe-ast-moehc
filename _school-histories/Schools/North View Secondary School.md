#### **School History**
North View Secondary was established in 1988. It was formerly known as Upper Thomson Secondary School, which was started in 1966. The school was renamed North View Secondary School when it relocated to Yishun Ring Road, though its Chinese name, 德贤中学, was retained. The school was officially opened in 1991, and became a single-session school in 1999.

In 2014, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme in Student Leadership through Design Thinking in Social Entrepreneurship. The programme aimed to develop students into leaders who would be globally positioned yet rooted in Singapore, with a strong sense of civic responsibility, and have a sense of mission in bettering the lives of others.

In the following year, North View was accorded the Applied Learning Programme in Robotic Engineering Design. The programme capitalised on the blended and interactive approach of robotic engineering and design to solve real-world problems using design thinking, with broad-based opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

In 2017, North View&nbsp;Secondary School merged with Northland&nbsp;Secondary School, taking on the latter’s name. The merged school currently operates at the&nbsp;site of Northland&nbsp;Secondary.

#### **School Motto**
A Vision to Service

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/northviewsec1.png">

The badge consists of the letters ‘N’ and ‘V’ enclosed in an outline of a leaf in white. The letters are slanted. The leaf depicts a new shoot that will grow into a strong plant as the years go by, symbolising the physical and mental development of the students. The slanting manner of the badge represents progress in all areas of school life. The letter ‘V’ in red symbolises the bright vision that the students have ahead, while the silver lines symbolise the students’ growth as they move ahead with technology.
