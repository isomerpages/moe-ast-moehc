#### **School History**
Horizon Primary School began operations on 4 January 2010 with 125 students from Primary One to Four and 13 pioneer staff, led by founding Principal Mrs Janet Ang. The pioneers laid a firm foundation for a student-centric, values-driven education and the Horizon spirit.&nbsp;

The school was officially opened on 4 October 2012. The school-wide leadership programme, I-LEAD, based on Stephen R. Covey’s&nbsp;_7 Habits of Highly Effective People_,was developed to nurture students to be effective self-leaders. The school was recognised as a Leader in Me School in 2013, and I-LEAD was awarded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) status in 2014.

In view of holistic development, in 2017, the school deepened its curriculum innovations including Design Thinking and Making Thinking Visible across subjects and also had its Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) weaved into the school curriculum time.&nbsp; This facilitated 100% of the students to further their interests and passion. The school’s LLP is refined and integrated into the core curriculum, and allows I-LEAD+ to be customised for the Character and Citizenship curriculum, with&nbsp;&nbsp;continued emphasis on student leadership. This change brings about a school-wide pervasive inculcation of self-leadership and tiered leadership platforms for all students.

Another milestone effort towards holistic education is the Computational Thinking in Mathematics programme, which became the Applied Learning Programme in 2018. It provides students with opportunities to learn and develop mathematical and computational thinking as well as dispositions such as persistence and resilience through block-based programming.

In 2018, the school underwent PERI upgrading. In 2020, Horizon Primary now operates a Ministry of Education kindergarten and kindergarten care services to serve the Punggol community.

Principals:<br>

Horizon is our school where we<br>
Learn values and truths,

To be compassionate, and be respectful,<br>
To have integrity in all we do.

We may come from many places<br>
And have different beliefs in life,

But like the sun’s rays in the Horizon<br>
We will shine brightly in the skies!<br>
Where a new day dawns! Horizon!<br>
We are where new light begins!<br>
We’re leaders of our own lives and<br>
Horizon Stars are we!<br>
Horizon Stars are we!

Horizon’s where we learn with joy<br>
Confident in all we do.

With trust and love; we strive for excellence;<br>
And be responsible in all we do.

We may come from many places<br>
And have different beliefs in life,

But like the sun’s rays in the Horizon<br>
We begin our walk with pride!

Where a new day dawns! Horizon!<br>
We are where new light begins!

We’re leaders of our own lives and<br>
Horizon Stars are we!<br>
Horizon Stars are we!
