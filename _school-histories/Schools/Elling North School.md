#### **School History**
Established in 1960, Elling North School was a co-ed school. The school was initially named Elling Boys’ School which was formed in 1958. When Elling Boys’ School started with an enrolment of 273 pupils, there were only eight teachers and English was the main language of instruction.

In 1961, Elling North School was converted into an integrated school with both English and Chinese stream students studying together.

Elling North School became a fully English medium school in 1980 after the last batch of pupils from the Chinese Stream graduated. The school was then renamed Elling North Primary School.

In 1985, Elling North Primary School merged with Elling South School to form Elling Primary School.

\- Mrs Chuah Chong Yong (1958 – 1960)<br>
\- Mrs Lee Siew Kwong (1960)<br>
\- Mr Lim Soo You (1961 – 1964)<br>
