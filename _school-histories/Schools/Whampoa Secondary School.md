#### **School History**
Established in 1961, Whampoa Secondary School was founded as a Chinese-medium school at St. George's Road.

The name of the school originated from Singapore’s pioneer businessman Mr Whampoa Hoo Ah Kay who was also the first Chinese merchant serving the Singapore Legislative Council in 1867.

In 1965, the school set up pre-university classes and became a full school. By 1968, Whampoa Secondary School had 1098 students with 58 teaching staff.

In 1972, the school participated in the Singapore Youth Festival with 1,000 students performing aerobics at the same time. Over the years, the school was known for its arts &amp; cultural activities and sports achievements such as volleyball, basketball and table tennis.

Whampoa Secondary School started its first English-medium class in 1981, seeing its last batch of Chinese-medium students graduating in 1987.

In 1994, the school ceased operations. It was located at 1 St. Wilfrid Road.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/whampoasec1.png">

The school crest is circular in shape to symbolise the bond between the students and the school management.

The use of blue stands for brotherhood and team spirit. The white space represents everlasting purity and virtue. The silver element stands for progress and prosperity.

The burning torch signifies truth and the passing of a tradition while and the four edges represent moral, intellectual, social and physical educational goals of the school.

‘Towards an all rounded education’ is the school motto.

#### **School Song**
曲: 丁祝三, 词: 黄戴灵 (1961)<br>
弘敷四育  德智体群<br>
既陶甄乎万类  期百年而树人<br>
乃兴四教  豫时逊摩<br>
鹄大成以渐进  学于焉而盈科<br>
猗欤黄埔  厥徳日新<br>
皇矣黄埔  卓乎不磨 (x2)

Composed by: C. W. Speir (1986)
