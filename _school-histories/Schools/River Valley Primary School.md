#### **School Motto**
Strive for the Best

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/rivervalleypri1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The red, green and gold colours give a vivid identity of the school. Red depicts ambition and strength. Green stands for peace and harmony. Gold, on which the other colours rest, reflects richness and boldness. The brightness of the gold resembles the rays of the sun.

The rings represent the three schools that had merged. The interlocking of the rings signifies the unity of the three schools upon merging. Through the unity, the symbol of a close bond between the staff, students and parents is also reflected.

The flame signifies the everlasting thirst for knowledge and the unceasing desire to strive for the best.

The letters ‘R.V.P.S.’ stand for River Valley Primary School.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Here we are at school to study and to play<br>
To meet our friends and work and do our part<br>
We speak English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay<br>
We are really one at heart.

Chorus:<br>
River Valley, River Valley<br>
River Valley Primary School<br>
River Valley, River Valley<br>
River Valley Primary School

Let us show our respect to the teachers all<br>
Learn of lands and people living far and near<br>
We will do right and not let our motto fall<br>
Oh, the future is so clear.

Chorus:<br>
River Valley, River Valley<br>
River Valley Primary School<br>
River Valley, River Valley<br>
River Valley Primary School
