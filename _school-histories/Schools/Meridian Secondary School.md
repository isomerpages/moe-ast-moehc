#### **School History**
Meridian Secondary School was formed in 2017 through the merger of Coral Secondary School and Siglap Secondary School. The school operates in the premises of the former Coral Secondary School at Pasir Ris Street 51. A new name, Meridian, was selected to give the merged school a distinctive identity, and members of the school are affectionately known as Meridians. Meridians aspire to sustain the good work of both schools to lead, care and inspire, to unite as One Team Meridian to reach new heights.

The merger brought about the opportunity to harness the talents of students and staff, and the best programmes of both schools. Meridian Secondary School was accorded the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in visual communications, and the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in community and youth leadership. Under the ALP, students are taught to effectively use different visual media to communicate meaningfully. It uses the design thinking framework to encourage students to think creatively and propose innovative solutions. The lessons range from classroom activities to learning journeys where students get to experience hands-on activities including illustration, photo-journalism and video-journalism.

The school’s LLP aims to strengthen the development of character and values in Meridians and challenge them to take the initiative to make a difference in society. This is achieved through the Student Leadership Development Model, which is based on observable skills and abilities that drive leadership behaviours such as effective communication, building trust and focusing on people.

In 2018, the school celebrated its first anniversary as one big Meridian family. To retain the heritage of the school, a gallery with information and artefacts from both schools was set up. The first alumni homecoming was also held that year.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/meridiansec1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is composed of the letter ‘M’, which stands for Meridian Secondary School, featuring with two adjoining peaks to represent the unity of Coral Secondary School and Siglap Secondary School. The peaks stand tall and exude strength in solid foundations. The colours of silver, blue and green symbolise innovation, leadership and the arts, respectively_._ The silver peaks symbolise an innovative environment to cultivate creative thinkers. Supporting the silver peaks are two pillars in blue and green, which signify the heritage of both schools. The blue pillar symbolises leadership, and the green pillar stands for the arts. Together, the crest represents the strength and unity of Meridians to reach new heights.
