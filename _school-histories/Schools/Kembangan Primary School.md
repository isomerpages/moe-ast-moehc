#### **School History**
Established in 1963, Kembangan Primary School was located along Jalan Kembangan. The school was initially named Kembangan Integrated Primary School.   
  
Kembangan Integrated Primary School started with 12 English-medium classes and 300 students. In 1967, Chinese-medium classes were introduced to the school’s curriculum and was phased out by 1975. From 1976, the school became an English-medium school and was renamed Kembangan Primary School.
