#### **School History**
Eunos Primary School was founded on 3 January 1984 with students and staff from Jalan Daud and Telok Kurau primary schools. The school underwent PRIME upgrading in 2002, and returned to its current location in 2004 after three years at a holding site. The new campus was officially opened on 23 March 2007.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Student Development in the Arts and through the Arts’, is a three-tier programme comprising a broad-based arts-appreciation curriculum, co-curricular programmes for targeted groups, and focused programmes for talented students. The school actively seeks opportunities to expose its students to performances and to put up public performances such as the successful Euni-Voices.&nbsp;

In 2021, Eunos Primary School merged with Telok Kurau Primary School. The merged school is located at the current site of Telok Kurau Primary School at Bedok Reservoir Road. After the merger, the merged school’s English name is Telok Kurau Primary School while her Chinese name is, 友诺小学. which symbolizes the promise of friendship.
