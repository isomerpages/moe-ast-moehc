#### **School History**
Qiaonan Primary School was founded on 26  May in 1933 by leaders of the Wenzhou Clan Association. They believed in the importance of education and took on the responsibility to lay a firm foundation for future generations. Originally named Kiau Nam School, it began with an enrolment of 20 students.

From a rented house in Lorong Koo Chye, the school later expanded to an enrolment of 85 students and moved to Lorong Tai Seng in 1938. In 1940, the director of the school board, Mr Liang Jin Hui, donated his house on Paya Lebar Road to be used by the school and its students. 

During the Japanese Occupation, the school’s first principal, Mr Wang Xi Yuan, was taken away by Japanese soldiers and was never seen again. The school was closed during the occupation and reopened in October 1945 after the war. It was formally registered with the Department of Education in 1946. In 1950, when the school funds were low, its staff members demonstrated their passion and care for the school by volunteering to have their salaries cut to help the school continue operations.

On 1 April 1957, the school became a government-aided school. In the same year, it set up a Diligence Award Fund to encourage good reading habits, improvement in schoolwork and good conduct. It also started its first English class in 1979, with English and Chinese as the first and second languages respectively.

In 1984, Kiau Nam School became a full government school. It merged with Pulau Tekong Primary School in 1985 and relocated to 15 Tampines Street 11. The merged school was officially renamed Qiaonan Primary School.

In 2008, the school celebrated its 75th anniversary. It continued focusing on providing an environment where each child would grow to have good character, resilience, open-mindedness, a well-balanced lifestyle and be imbued with feelings of social responsibility.

On 26 July 2013, Qiaonan Primary School celebrated its 80th anniversary.

In 2015, Qiaonan Primary School merged with Griffiths Primary School and became known as Angsana Primary School.

#### **School Motto**
Persevere to Excel

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/qiaonanpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The badge, in the shape of an open book, symbolises an emphasis on continuous learning and improvement. At the base of the book are five rings upholding the learning experience of the students. The five rings symbolise the five values promoted by the school: health, knowledge, co-operation, creativity and virtue. The interlinked rings reflect the school’s continual efforts to inculcate these values in the students.

The dark blue colour symbolises the integrity with which the school carries out its duties. Yellow symbolises the excellence that the school strives to achieve, and red signifies the school’s passion in upholding its core values: search for new knowledge, strengthen the total being, support one another, seek to innovate and strive for good character.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

On our Lion City Qiaonan School stands<br>
Reaching out to the skies and looking grand.<br>
Where-in we are all nurtured<br>
to be learned and cultured.<br>
Ever keeping up with time<br>
so we won’t be left behind.<br>
With one another we will share,<br>
For each other we will care<br>
With the spirit that is Qiaonan<br>
Working mind and heart as one.<br>
And with the same unity,<br>
we will serve our country<br>
as loyal citizens should,<br>
For all Singaporeans good.
