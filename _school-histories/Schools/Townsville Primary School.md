#### **School History**
Townsville Primary School was established in 1983, originally located at Ang Mo Kio Street 32. In 1985, the school was officially declared open. In 1989, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain visited the school.

In 2000, the school moved to its present location at 3 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10. The following year, it merged with Chong Shan Primary School, which had earlier amalgamated with Chong De in 1998. Townsville Primary School’s new campus was officially declared open in 2002. 

In 2013, the Ministry of Education granted the school niche status in visual arts under the Programme for School-based Excellence. Through the visual arts programme, Townsville Primary aims to develop students’ communication, critical and creative thinking skills.

In 2017, Townsville Primary School celebrated another milestone with its 35th anniversary in educating and developing students to be future-ready.

#### **School Motto**
Do Our Best

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/townsvillepri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest shows a triangle symbolising stability and steadfastness. The school logo, consisting of the letters ‘T’ and ‘P’ (initials of Townsville Primary), is white in colour. It symbolises the innocence and purity of young, untarnished minds. It rests in the centre of the inner royal-blue triangle.  
  
The motto, ‘Do Our Best’, is placed above the logo, and the name of the school is positioned at the base of the triangle to reinforce the school’s strong determination to mould and shape each student according to individual needs, capabilities and changing trends.

Townsville<br>
The name that's most dear<br>
To every staff and student here<br>
You've taught us how to care and share<br>
To do our best and never despair

Wisdom and wit we'll require<br>
Creative thinkers we aspire<br>
Lifelong learners we want to be<br>
Brave people of integrity

Chorus<br>
Townsville our guide<br>
To you we pledge<br>
We'll do our best<br>
Townsville our pride<br>
To Singapore loyal we'll be<br>
Townsville our guide<br>
To you we pledge<br>
We'll do our best<br>
Townsville our pride<br>
We'll keep our colours flying high
