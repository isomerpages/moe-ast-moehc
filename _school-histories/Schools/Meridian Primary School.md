#### **School History**
Established in 2000, Meridian Primary School was the seventh primary school in the western sector of Pasir Ris New Town. The school started with 168 students in five Primary One classes. It operated from Coral Primary School for a year, where it had its afternoon session after Coral Primary finished their classes in the morning. Meridian Primary School moved to its present location at 20 Pasir Ris Street 71 on 4 December 2000. During the first year at its new location, the school operated with classes from Primary One to Primary Four with 13 staff, eight of whom were teachers.

In 2000, Meridian Primary School also established its School Advisory Committee and Parent Support Group. Till today, these committees continue to play a key role in supporting the school. Through the years, Meridian Primary School has grown in strength, and now operates as a single-session school with 25 classes and a student population of 751. Meridian Primary School was officially opened on 21 September 2002.

In 2014, Meridian Primary School’s niche area on eco-environment transited into the Applied Learning Programme (ALP). The school has designed a variety of experiential learning experiences, including growing hydroponics vegetables, to raise the students’ awareness on eco-environmental issues.

In 2016, the school was accorded the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in Student Leadership development. The programme adopts a whole-school approach and leads the students through the learning process using the “Head, Heart and Hand” approach.  
  
The school will be having her 20th&nbsp;Anniversary Celebrations in 2020.

#### **School Motto**
To Learn, To Love, To Lead

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/meridianpri1.png">

The Meridian crest embodies the spirit of a dynamic, forward-looking learning organisation that moves ahead with the times. The globe, anchored at the two strategic points, signifies that Meridian has a global outlook, but stays rooted in timeless values. The well-defined strokes of the stylised ‘M’ denote the school’s emphasis on the development of character, body and mind of each individual.

Within the globe, the four Meridian lines flow harmoniously from north to south. They symbolise the four stakeholders – school, students, parents and the community – working in close partnership to achieve the desired outcome of education.

The colour blue represents the vast expanse of knowledge and skills that its pupils acquire through continuous learning. Silver signifies hope and optimism in the journey of discovery at Meridian. The transformation of colours from blue to silver symbolises the adaptability and flexibility of the school’s environment in meeting new challenges.
