The shield represents excellence in the students’ work, while the torch represents the desire for continual learning. The book signifies the acquisition of knowledge, and the paintbrush stands for a focus on the arts for gracious living. The figures represent mass participation in physical education, sports and games for physical, emotional and social development. The five rings symbolise unity and harmony among members of the school and the community.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

This is our anthem, this is our pride,<br>
This is our school Bedok West,<br>
In the east of Singapore.

This is our anthem, this is our pride,<br>
This is our school Bedok West,<br>
We will be true to you.

This here we learn to read, write and count.<br>
This here we learn to be courteous too.<br>
For school and country, loyal and true.<br>
In blue and white the same we will always be.

(Words and Music by Bernard Low)
