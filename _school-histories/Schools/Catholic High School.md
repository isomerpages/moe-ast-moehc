#### **School History**
Catholic High School (CHS) is a government-aided all-boys Catholic full school, comprising a secondary and a primary section. It enrols both Catholic and non-Catholic students.

Founded in 1935 by the late Rev Fr Edward Becheras, a French missionary, the school had its humble beginnings within the premises of the Church of Saints Peter and Paul on Queen Street, with the pioneering support of the Chinese Catholic Action Society and then Principal Yao Kwok Wah. Rev Fr Becheras envisioned the school as an institution of learning where one could acquire competence in bilingualism. Till today, the school’s philosophy is still anchored on the enunciation of Rev Fr Becheras: “The way of the Catholic High School is a way made of two rails – Chinese and English, free from any entanglement, straight to its end. Happy are those who follow. They shall obtain the scope of a sound education.”

Originally a small hut partitioned into two classrooms – for orphans and the poor – CHS soon expanded into a city campus occupying both sides of Queen Street. In 1950, Principal Yao was promoted to Inspector for Chinese Schools by the Education Department, and the Diocese invited the Marist Brothers to lead the school. The school became renowned for its unique culture of bilingualism, character values, discipline, academic rigour and extra-curricular pursuits.

In 1979, CHS was accorded the Special Assistance Plan status. The school continued to expand; by the 1980s, it was operating concurrently in premises at Queen Street, Gentle Road, Norfolk Road, Bishan Street 12 and Bright Hill Drive. The separate campuses were reunited at its present Bishan site in 1992.

In 1995, the secondary section attained autonomous status, and three years later, the primary section commenced the Gifted Education Programme. In 2013, the secondary section embarked on the unique dual-track model: the Joint Integrated Programme and the O-Level Programme. Together with students from CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ School and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, CHS students would enrol in Eunoia Junior College for their pre-tertiary education under the integrated programme.

From the school motto ‘亲爱忠诚敬业乐群 Care Honesty Service’ to the current tagline ‘#mybloodisgreen’, the CHS experience is defined by a strong sense of brotherhood and camaraderie; values-driven character development and service leadership; all-round excellence in academic and non-academic domains; and scholarly pursuits.&nbsp; For over 80 years,&nbsp;CHS has&nbsp;nurtured leaders and professionals in various fields who give back to society and the school, and it will continue to develop principled leaders, gentlemen and bilingual scholars with the skills, perspectives and hearts to touch lives and transform futures.

#### **School Motto**
亲爱忠诚<br>
敬业乐群  

_Care, Honesty, Service_

Care: Showing love for one’s nearest next-of-kin, one’s fellowmen and all living things. This is a manifestation of the spirit and essence of traditional Chinese culture.

Honesty: One who wishes to attain a whole personality ought to be honest, faithful, sincere and to be imbued with other fine virtues.

Service: The ability to serve springs from one’s recognition of being part of a community and one’s responsibility to his fellow human beings.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:25%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/catholichighsch1.jpg">

The colour blue symbolises the infinite and boundless universe in which Man is free to think and choose how best to spend one’s time developing character as an individual who does not wall another off from the community, and simultaneously does not suffocate one’s own individuality. A person’s entity in humanity is a lesson of good faith guided by trust in God.

The Cross represents Jesus Christ who suffered and died for the salvation of all mankind. It is a reminder that one must patiently shoulder the responsibilities to society and to the self. To this end, one shall reap the fruits of the labour of love such as peace, joy, forbearance, temperance and brotherly kindness.

The light signifies that Jesus Christ is the light of the universe. The light of Christ shines far and wide, it also illuminates the correct and righteous path so that one may walk boldly and wisely.

Translation:<br>
Catholic High School stands tall,<br>
On this Island of Singapore;<br>
Serene and picturesque are its precincts,<br>
And to Heaven does its spire soar.<br>
Propagating Cultural heritage: East, West anzd more.<br>
Striving towards excellence is our very goal.<br>
Promoting bilingualism benefits one and all.<br>
Cultivating virtues as steadfast as mountains amidst turbulence.

Diligent are the boys in scholastic pursuits,<br>
Joyfully they sing, play and grow,<br>
Never slackening in life-long learning,<br>
Never departing from social mores.

Through the clear sky the white clouds float,<br>
Into the deep sea the green waters flow.<br>
On this tropical island,<br>
We build a nation, forever strong and free,<br>
Reaching out together from here to eternity.
