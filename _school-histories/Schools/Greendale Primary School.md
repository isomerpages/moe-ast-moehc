#### **School History**
Greendale Primary School started officially on 1 January 2008. From a school of 214 students and 16 teachers, the school has grown to have almost 1,500 students and over 100 school staff.&nbsp;

The school’s mission is to nurture each child holistically through excellence in teaching and learning. This has led the school to develop many innovative programmes to develop its students in all domains. In 2014, the school implemented its Applied Learning Programme, ‘Developing Critical and Inventive Thinking Skills through Toy Design’. The programme aims to develop students’ critical and inventive thinking skills through the toy-making.

The school’s Learning for Life Programme, ‘Developing 21st Century Lifelong Learners through Outdoor Education’, takes learning beyond the classroom to enable students to acquire relevant life skills and to appreciate and care for the environment. The programme also nurtures students to be more adaptable and confident through active participation in various outdoor activities such as sports climbing, hiking and adventure camps.

Greendale Primary celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2017.&nbsp; In January 2018, the school commenced its two-year school upgrading to enhance its teaching and learning facilities as well as its working environment. Greendale Primary continues the journey begun by the pioneer team to realise its vision of ‘An excellent community of learners anchored in values’.

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/greendalepri1.png">

The school emblem shows the letter “G” drawn with a bold artistic brush stroke, supporting a circle emerging from an orange box. The green is symbolic of a&nbsp;**youth in harmony**&nbsp;with others and with the environment. The orange depicts the&nbsp;**vibrant school environment**&nbsp;that fans the&nbsp;**passion for learning**.&nbsp; Drawn with the traditional brush, the strokes signify the focus of the school in developing&nbsp;**children of character**, anchored in sound values.&nbsp; The emerging circle underlines the mission of the school in developing the whole child through balanced educational programmes, moulding them to be&nbsp;**innovative**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**global in outlook**, and daring to aspire high – to the stars!
