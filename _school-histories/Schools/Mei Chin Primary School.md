#### **School History**
Mei Chin Primary School was established on 2 January 1976 at 3 Mei Chin Road. It had an initial enrolment of more than 1,400 students in 35 classes. It was officially declared open on 25 March.

Mei Chin Primary was one of the first primary schools in Queenstown to initiate a comprehensive IT programme for its students. The school also published a regular newsletter, the _Mei Chin Herald_.

In late 1989, the school enlarged its science garden and incorporated a pond into the garden so that students could study aquatic communities and the relationships among organisms in their natural habitat. Students were also allocated small garden plots for sowing seeds for the observation of life cycles, germination of plants and the reaction of plants to external stimuli. A miniature aviary, housing a variety of birds, was also included.

In 1990, Mei Chin Primary was selected to participate in the “Helping Underachievers Programme”, a project by the Ministry of Education aimed at helping lower primary students overcome their learning difficulties.

In 1991, the school underwent two-and-a-half months’ renovations to its building and physical environment. 

In January 2002, Mei Chin Primary School and Tanglin Primary School merged with Queenstown Primary School.
