#### **School History**
In 2012, the Ministry of Education announced seven new schools for Primary One registration. Sengkang Green Primary School (SGPS), located at 15 Fernvale Road, was one of them. The first principal designate, Mrs Daphne Yeoh and vice-principal designate, Mr Martin Chan, led a team of 15 teaching and administrative staff to prepare the school for welcoming 180 Primary One students the following year. The school is built with the PERI recommended school facilities such as the indoor sports hall, synthetic field, performing arts studio and student care centre. At the end of 2017, Mr Gau Poh Teck took over the leadership of the school. The MOE Kindergarten sited within the primary school comes under the administration of the primary school since 2018.

Character education is fundamental in the school’s curriculum, providing students with quality experiences in the cognitive, physical, aesthetics, social and moral domains. Since its opening, SGPS has been a school of choice in the Sengkang South neighbourhood. It provides quality education to a population of more than 1,400 students today. In 2014, SGPS infused character education with arts education, and was recognised with the Learning for Life Programme, ‘ICAR2E Through the Arts’. 

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Daphne Yeoh (2013–2017)<br>
\- Mr Gau Poh Teck (2017–present)

#### **School Motto**
Ready to Serve, Ready for the Future

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/sengkanggreenpri1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Inspired by the Tembusu tree, which is a hardy, evergreen tropical tree, the school crest pictures a growing young tree that represents a growing child who is anchored in strong values, thriving in a fast-changing, globalised world. The child, also represented by an open book, is a lifelong learner with a thirst for knowledge and excellence. The child is well supported by parents and teachers, forming a strong partnership in providing an all-round education, balancing the development of character and abilities.

The logo is presented in the two distinct school colours of green and orange. Green represents the learning and growth of children. Orange represents the vibrancy of children, who hold the key to the future of the nation.
