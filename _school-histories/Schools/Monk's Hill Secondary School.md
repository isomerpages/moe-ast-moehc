<h4><strong>School Motto</strong></h4>
<p>The Will To Win</p>
<h4><strong>School Crest</strong></h4>
<p>The lion is Singapore’s national symbol, representing strength, nobility
and fearlessness. The colour red, the underlying motif, signifies the fiery
exuberance in the school’s endeavours.</p>
<p>The open book is a revelation of knowledge and wisdom, with the colour
yellow representing the sanctity of Education.</p>
<p>The temple bell is a symbol of the school’s historical past and a harbinger
of the Monkshillian Spirit. The branching laurel of the school’s diverse
achievements rests on a gentle blue, the colour of humility and quiet reflection.</p>
