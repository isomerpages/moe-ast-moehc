#### **School History**
Nanyang Junior College was established in the 1970s to meet the growing demand for junior college education. The Building Committee was formed in 1972 and construction of the college began in October 1976. Mr Chia Khoon Hock was appointed the Principal Designate on 1 August 1977.&nbsp; The college was initially named Lorong Chuan Junior College because of its location. On 19 November 1977, it was renamed Nanyang Junior College.

The first cohort of about 600 students started classes in January 1978 at a temporary school building vacated by Westlake Secondary School. In December that year, the college moved to its new premises at Lorong Chuan. On 26 January 1980, the Building Committee was dissolved and in its place a School Management Committee was formed. The college was officially opened on 19 May 1980.

In its first five years, Nanyang Junior College focused on building its identity. Subsequently, the college consolidated the hard work put in by pioneer educators and the School Management Committee. The quality of education was raised to match the best of the junior colleges in Singapore. The learning environment was substantially improved in the 1990s. The Games Complex was set up in 1990 and a three-storey Resource Centre was built in 1993.

The 1990s also saw the launch of two important academic programmes in Nanyang Junior College. In 1997, the college was selected to be the second junior college to offer the Art Elective Programme. In 1999, it was selected as the third centre to offer the Chinese Language Elective Programme.

At the turn of the century, Nanyang Junior College was rebuilt on site under PRIME. In 2004 a spanking new building, with a modern architecture and up-to-date facilities, was completed. In the same year, the college held a four-in-one celebratory programme comprising the 25th College Day Prize Giving Ceremony, the official opening of the College Alumni Clubhouse, the unveiling of the art mural,&nbsp;_Eblouissant_, and the Homecoming Carnival.

Today, Nanyang Junior College is a reputable and popular college. It is recognised for its consistent excellent academic results, niche sports, arts and aesthetic programmes. The college also focuses on the inculcation of values and the nurturing of student leaders, and adopts a whole-of-college approach in engaging students in service learning.

<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/nanyangjc1.jpg">

The college crest is a red shield with a blue base; the red and blue colours are separated by a row of four yellow crescents. Superimposed on this is a white lion’s head. The red colour of the shield symbolises unity in strength. The blue represents the Southern Ocean, or ‘Nanyang’. The lion’s head stands for Singapore, while the four crescents signify the multiracial nature as well as the growth of the college in tandem with the nation.

Verse 1<br>
Like the rising fountain,<br>
Our ardent hopes reach to the sky.<br>
But the fountain stands alone<br>
Though not you and I.

Chorus<br>
For together we plan,<br>
Together we build,<br>
A firm foundation is our stand.<br>
United our course,<br>
Forward we march,<br>
Our College’s name proclaim.

Verse 2<br>
Like the graceful palm tree,<br>
We stand together strong and free.<br>
Yet the palm tree stands alone,<br>
A lonely sight to see.

Chorus<br>
Verse 3<br>
Like the ever burning flame,<br>
Our youthful hearts with fervour glow,<br>
Yet the bright flame burns alone,<br>
That’s not right we know.
  
Chorus
