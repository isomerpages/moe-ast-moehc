#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/eunoiajc1.jpg" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The college crest represents the three qualities of all-round development, beautiful thinking and cultural conversance. The circular shape signifies the holistic development of Eunoians, and it is complemented by the geometry of the college wordmark and typeface. The design of the crest is inspired by the neural networks of the human brain, signifying beautiful thinking. At the same time, the design depicts the name ‘Eunoia’, with an Asian theme. This signifies that Eunoians are able to thrive in diverse cultural settings while remaining rooted to their own culture.
