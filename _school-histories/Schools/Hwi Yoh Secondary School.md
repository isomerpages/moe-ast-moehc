#### **School History**
Established in 1967, Hwi Yoh Secondary School was located at Jalan Hwi Yoh. Hwi Yoh Secondary School offered technical and academic subjects in both English and Chinese. As such, the school served as a centralised workshop for neighbouring schools.   
  
In 1984, Hwi Yoh Secondary School merged with Parry Secondary School to form Peicai Secondary School. The name of Peicai Secondary School was derived from an amalgamation of the Chinese names of Hwi Yoh Secondary School and Parry Secondary School.   
  
Following the closure of Hwi Yoh Secondary School in 1984, residential estates have occupied the former site of the school.
