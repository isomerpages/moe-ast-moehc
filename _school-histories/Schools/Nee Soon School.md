#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Nee Soon School was located at Nee Soon Road. The school was also known as Nee Soon Primary School and Nee Soon English Primary School.&nbsp;  
  
Over time, the number of students in the school fell. In 1986, Nee Soon School closed . In 1987, the remaining students of Nee Soon School were transferred to Peixin Primary School. Peixin Primary School merged with &nbsp;Yishun Primary School in 2009.&nbsp;  
  
The former site of Nee Soon School was left vacant for several years after its closure in 1986. It was then used as a National Cadet Corps campsite. This campsite was closed &nbsp;later and the land has remained vacant since then.
