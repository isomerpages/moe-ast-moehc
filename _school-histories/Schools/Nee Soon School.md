#### **School History**
Established in 1954, Nee Soon School was located at Nee Soon Road. The school was also known as Nee Soon Primary School and Nee Soon English Primary School.   
  
Over time, the number of students in the school fell. In 1986, Nee Soon School closed . In 1987, the remaining students of Nee Soon School were transferred to Peixin Primary School. Peixin Primary School merged with  Yishun Primary School in 2009.   
  
The former site of Nee Soon School was left vacant for several years after its closure in 1986. It was then used as a National Cadet Corps campsite. This campsite was closed  later and the land has remained vacant since then.
