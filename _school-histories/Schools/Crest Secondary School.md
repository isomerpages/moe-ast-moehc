#### **School History**
Crest Secondary School was first announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2010 National Day Rally to be the first specialised school for students in the Normal (Technical), or N(T), stream. The school received its first batch of Secondary One students in January 2013.

The name ‘Crest’ underlines the school’s aim of helping every Crestan ride their crest of personal transformation, regardless of background. Right from the start, Crest has taken on a mission-driven focus of advocating a promising future for every student.

The school started off by offering four Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Skills Certificate (ISC) courses in hospitality services, retail services, facility services and mechanical Servicing. Students would graduate with two certifications: the General Certification of Education N(T) Level Certificate and the ISC.

To keep up with future industry developments, ITE and the Ministry of Education conducted a curriculum review in 2018. The ISC would be replaced by the ITE Skills Subjects Certification (ISSC) in 2021. The ISSC offers the following areas: (i) Culinary and Restaurant Operations, (ii) Retail and E-Commerce, (iii) Internet of Things, (iv) Mechanical Design and Automation and (v) Mobile Web Applications. In 2019, Secondary One students were offered related taster modules to prepare them for their choice of ISSC.

The school offers an in-house Student Development Programme and Visual Arts Talent Development Programme to deepen students’ social and emotional competencies. Students are also involved in local and overseas Cultural Immersion and Values-in-Action Programmes as well as School Twinning Programmes to enrich their learning experiences. These programmes empower the students with self-confidence and provide them with the exposure to various learning experiences to support their growth.

Crest Secondary School was officially opened in 2015 and is located at 561 Jurong East Street 24.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/crestsecsch1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school logo is based on the theme, CREating Student Transformation (CREST). It comprises four outward expanding waves, reflecting the transformation of the students from Secondary One to Secondary Four as they grow in character (represented by the light blue waves) and attain breakthroughs in personal achievements (represented by the yellow waves).

This transformation is made possible by a sea of opportunities (represented by the dark blue background) that the school provides to enrich students’ learning and enhance their personal growth.

**I Know I Can**

Verse 1:<br>
I have found a place<br>
Where my heart is free to dream<br>
It's here that I belong<br>
Where strength rises from within<br>
All the things I hope for<br>
They're mine to strive for<br>
I'll rise up to the challenge<br>
To turn my dreams into reality

Chorus:<br>
I know I can<br>
I'm reaching high<br>
To touch the sky<br>
I'm not afraid to try<br>
To realise my dreams<br>
Upon this Crest<br>
I'll do my best<br>
To be all that I was meant to be<br>
I'll shout it to the world<br>
I know I can

Verse 2:<br>
The road will not be easy<br>
But no matter how long it seems<br>
I'll just keep walking on<br>
I'll never give up on my dreams<br>
There'll always be a helping hand<br>
And someone who will be a friend<br>
In this place that feels like home<br>
I know I'll never have to walk alone

(Chorus x 2)
