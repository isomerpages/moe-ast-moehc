#### **School History**
Peirce Secondary School was established in 1994 at the premises of Bishan Park Secondary School. On 17 February 1995, the school moved to its current premises at 10 Sin Ming Walk. The indoor sports hall was completed at the end of 2008 following PRIME upgrading. In 2009, Peirce Secondary was accorded niche status for uniformed groups. The school’s synthetic turf was completed and put to use in June 2011. In 2014, the school celebrated its 20th anniversary. Peirce Secondary merged with Bishan Park Secondary School in January 2018, and the new Peirce Secondary School operated from its site at 10 Sin Ming Walk.

The school’s Applied Learning Programme is in languages, with a focus on broadcast journalism. The programme allows students to apply English and mother tongue language skills from various genres in an authentic setting to communicate and serve the community. Its Learning for Life Programme is in community and youth leadership, which aims to develop leadership skills progressively in all students – starting with personal and community leadership and culminating in executive leadership. All students will acquire basic leadership competencies, social emotional skills, and values to become community leaders.

#### **School Motto**
Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae – The Passion for Glory is a Torch to the Mind

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/peircesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is shaped like a torch. The flame ignites the minds of students – a reference to the school motto, ‘Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae’, which is Latin for ‘The Passion for Glory is a Torch to the Mind’. Students of Peirce strive for glory and excellence, which will spur them to be innovative, creative and courageous. Within the triangle are the school initials, ‘PS’. The triangle also symbolises the tripartite efforts of parents, students and teachers to help students succeed.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae<br>
The passion for glory is the torch to the mind<br>
We of Peirce do pledge to achieve<br>
Excellence, honour for our school<br>
We dare to venture; forward we go<br>
We know no obstacles along the way<br>
Those who fall will rise again<br>
And claim victory on another day<br>
Let our ambitions be fulfilled<br>
Let our minds be liberated<br>
Let the flame of Peirce be ignited<br>
Fax Mentis Incendium Gloriae
