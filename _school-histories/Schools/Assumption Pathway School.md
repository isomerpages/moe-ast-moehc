#### **School History**
Assumption Pathway School (APS) was founded on 17 January 1938 as St Joseph’s Trade School. It was started by two religious brothers from the Catholic Order of the Brothers of St Gabriel. In 1970, St Joseph’s Trade School was renamed Boys’ Town Trade School. A year later, it was renamed Boys’ Town Vocational Institute. On 1 April 1994, the institute was renamed as Assumption Vocational Institute (AVI) to facilitate enrolment of female students in January 1995. In tandem with changes in the educational landscape, AVI became APS in 2009 with an expanded curriculum, particularly in foundation subjects and character education.

APS is a Catholic educational institution that aims to transform and empower students who are unable to access or complete secondary education, so that they may achieve personal success. The school is managed by the St Gabriel’s Foundation under the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel, an order of the Catholic Teaching Brothers founded by St Louis Marie de Montfort.

As a specialised school, APS offers vocational programmes accredited by the Institute of Technical Education as well as foundation and character development programmes developed in collaboration with the Ministry of Education.

The school was officially opened in 2012 and is currently located at 30 Cashew Road.

The school’s niche areas are Culinary Skills and Baking Practices.  In Year 2015 Baking Production Kitchen (BPK) was set up to provide on the job training to students.   The BPK led to the launched of students’ managed canteen stalls "'Bake & Brew Delights'‘ in APS and Assumption English School in Year 2016.   In Year 2019, "pod" was set up in Jurong Secondary School to provide wider platform and exposure for students to be work ready.

In 2018, the school celebrated its 10th anniversary with President of Singapore, Madam Halimah Yaacob as the Guest of Honour.

The school is honoured to collaborate with National Gallery Singapore (NGS) to have an Art Exhibition with their renowned artists in Year 2019.  Some of the students’ artwork have been selected for exhibit for the whole year and new artworks will be exhibited up to Year 2020.

Principals:<br>
\- Mr Wee Tat Chuen (2009 – 2013)<br>
\- Mr Eric Leong Yew Hon (2014 – present)

#### **School Motto**
Through Hard Work Achieve Success

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/assumptionpathwaysch1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The crest identifies all the schools in Singapore that are governed under the Catholic Order of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel. Assumption Pathway School is one of these schools.

The centrepiece of the school crest is the Coat of Arm, which has four quadrants. These quadrants contain symbols representing the core beliefs of the founder of the order, St Louis Marie de Montfort. These beliefs include God as the central motivating force in one’s life, the attainment of wisdom through living a life of gentleness and authenticity, perseverance and resilience in order to conquer life’s challenges.

The Crest carries the Latin motto “Labor Omnia Vincit” which stands for “Labour conquers all things.” Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life. The crest therefore motivates us to do our best in whatever we do.

#### **School Song**
**Audio, require school to upload on youtube**

Once more unite our youthful voices<br>
Amidst our halls the strain to raise<br>
With rapid swell the heart rejoices<br>
When virtue is the theme of praise<br>
We follow those who have trodden up-rightly<br>
As well in sunshine as in rain<br>
Students old and new we do fashion so tightly<br>
Enduring links of one long chain
   
We, students of Assumption Pathway School<br>
When God from on high sheds his light on our way<br>
We, students of Assumption Pathway School<br>
The White and the Blue shall be known far and wide<br>
The White and the Blue, the White and the Blue<br>
Shall be ever Boys' Town's pride
