#### **School History**
Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School (PLMGS) began on 31 October 1916 when the Secretary of the Methodist Episcopal Building and Location Board purchased a piece of land at Boundary Road to build a school. It was a branch of the Anglo-Chinese School and was known then as Paya Lebar English School. It began functioning as an all-boys elementary school in 1917 with three staff and 24 boys. In the following year, it began taking in girls.

In 1935, Mrs Chew Hock Hin became the principal. She reorganised the school after the Second World War, during which the school building was occupied by Japanese forces and badly damaged. Despite the lack of facilities, the demand for places in the school was overwhelming. PLMGS needed space to provide better facilities for more students. In 1986, PLMGS relocated from Boundary Road to its present larger site on Lorong Ah Soo. With the relocation, two schools were created: Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ Primary School and Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ Secondary School. They were officially declared open on 22 August 1987.

Rooted in Christian values, Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ Secondary School is an iconic part of the Kovan community. It is a ‘home’ for girls of different social backgrounds, races and religions. Families from the surrounding communities entrust their daughters to the values-driven education with which the mission school is synonymous. Now an established institution, the school’s growth and transformation have been in tandem with nation-building. The school’s mission is to educate girls with different strengths to realise their full potential and find their place in society.

The holistic education builds character and talent in aesthetics, sports or uniformed groups. The school’s Board of Management, parents, alumni and staff invest time and effort by actively participation in the school’s programmes. In strengthening the vibrant arts culture, which is a niche area, PLMGS (Sec) together with PLMGS (Pri) have been the East Zone Centre of Excellence for Creative Arts since 2008.&nbsp; This has resulted in collaborative work with schools in the east zone in developing arts education in schools at the national level.

An autonomous school since 2002, PLMGS (Sec) has attained Best Practice Awards in Staff Well-Being, Teaching and Learning, and Student All-round Development. In 2012, during the Ministry of Education’s external validation exercise, the school was accorded the School Excellence Award, the pinnacle award in the Ministry’s Masterplan of Awards.

<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/plmgssec1.jpg">

The school crest has a cross above the words ‘Paya Lebar MGS’, signifying that Christ is above all. The lines radiating from the cross suggest that the light of God will shine through the school. The background is yellow, which stands for brightness and light, for the school is to be like a beacon to the community.

O let our youthful voices ring<br>
With all their joyfulness<br>
In praise and gladness let us sing<br>

Here we may seek all wisdom, truth<br>
And ways of kindliness<br>
Through all the years of golden youth<br>

So when we leave its shelt’ring walls<br>
We go with fearlessness<br>
Enriched to face life’s greatest call<br>

Now let us pray and learn and trust and obey<br>
To serve Him in every way<br>
Glory to God we give and pray<br>
For Paya Lebar MGS
