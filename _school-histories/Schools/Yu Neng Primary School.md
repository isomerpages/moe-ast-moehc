#### **School History**
In 1934, the late Mr Huang Hua Long, along with four humble villagers, took upon themselves the responsibility of nurturing and educating the young. With meagre resources, they managed to build a zinc and attap school named Yeu Nerng School. Conducting lessons in Mandarin and dialect, Yeu Nerng catered to 20 students from the neighbouring villages. Despite poverty and the difficult times, the students of Yeu Nerng achieved commendable examination results.

After the Japanese Occupation, the school was reopened. By 1960, the school had an enrolment of about 100 students. The enrolment grew to about 693 in 1978 with a staff strength of 23 teachers. With a committed new management committee, Yeu Nerng grew to have nine classrooms and was operating in double-session. Over the years, the school consistently managed an overall percentage of passes that was above the national average in the Primary School Leaving Examination.

Yeu Nerng Public School continued to grow from strength to strength. In 1982, it moved to Bedok North Street 3 to cater to a rapidly expanding student population. The school also changed its status from an aided to a government school, and was renamed Yu Neng Primary School. English was adopted as the school’s medium of instruction. In January 2003, the school underwent PRIME upgrading and moved to a holding site. During this period, the school merged with Min Xin Primary School. In 2005, the school returned to its premises at Bedok North Street 3 and was officially reopened in July 2006.

Through the years, Yu Neng Primary School has maintained the traits and virtues of its founders. It celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2015. With its rich history, strong foundation, values and beliefs, Yu Neng continues to grow and strive towards its motto of ‘Light Up and Shine’.

#### **School Motto**
Light Up and Shine

#### **School Crest**
<img align="left" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/yunengpri1.png">

The school crest shows an open book signifying the acquisition of knowledge. The torch represents the light that shines and guides the students as they strive towards excellence, being good examples to others. The unbroken circle stands for ‘total education’, which encompasses social, aesthetic, moral, physical and academic development. This symbol of togetherness also signifies everyone in the school working together to achieve common objectives and to educate students to the best of their abilities.

The colours red, blue, yellow and white are used in the school crest. Red symbolises warm-heartedness and benevolence, blue for joy and happiness, yellow for the light that guides the students, and white for purity.
