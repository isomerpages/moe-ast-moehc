#### **School History**
Greendale Secondary School opened its doors to the first intake of 320 Secondary 1 students on 2 January 2006. The school derived its “green” from Punggol’s rustic, green and waterfront living setting, with “dale” providing a link to its location at Edgedale Plains. The school was officially opened by Dr Teo Chee Hean, who was then the Minister for Defence, Minister-in-charge of the Civil Service and MP for Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC, in 2007.

The School Mission: **_Nurturing Talents_, _Developing Character_, _Inspiring Lives_**, hinges on the school’s strong belief and aspiration to develop every member of the Greendale community to be a life-long **_Learner_** who takes personal responsibility and initiative in his own development and personal mastery, a critical **_Thinker_** who seeks clarity and possibilities, and a confident **_Leader_** who seeks to serve his community with humility and confidence.

The school aspires to be a school of choice that makes a difference and a home of **_Committed Learners_**, **_Critical Thinkers_** and **_Confident Leaders_** who **SERVE, LEAD** and **EXCEL.**

Principals:<br>
\- Mrs Mary Koh (2006–2008)<br>
\- Mr Mark Gerard Minjoot  (2009–2015)<br>
\- Ms Amy Ng (2015–present)

#### **School Motto**
The school motto, **_LEAD, SERVE and EXCEL_**, serves to rally staff and students to _Lead_ by example, _Serve_ the community with humility and confidence, and Excel in all endeavours and to make a difference to school, community and nation.

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/greendalesec1.png" style="width:20%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The school crest is made up of three design elements in the shape of letter G, D and L, which form the acronym of the school name GDL. The letters G and D, which are arranged close together to look like the abbreviation of the word ‘Good’. This signifies that Greendale is a Good school. The upward orientation of letter ‘D’ symbolises the school’s aspiration to excel. The design of letter ‘L’ resembles a springboard which symbolises the school’s commitment to value-add to the development of the students and propel them to greater heights.  

Red, yellow and orange in the school crest symbolise the school’s passion, energy, joy, enthusiasm for learning. Green is associated with the rustic and green surrounding.

The brown diamond ring and school motto were subsequently added to the original design in 2008. The brown ring symbolises the school’s desire to provide a safe environment that is conducive for teaching and learning.  The school motto emphasises the commitment of staff and students to **_Lead_**, **_Serve_** and _**Excel**_**.**
