### **About Us**
MOE Heritage Centre showcases Singaporeâ€™s Education Story from the early 19th century to the present. The Centre is set-up to inspire those aspiring to be teachers, affirm the work of serving educators and commemorate the contributions of educators and communities that have shaped education since the founding of Singapore.

Located at the site of the former New Town Primary School at Commonwealth Drive, work started in 2007 with the setting up of a research team to conduct research and develop a story line for the galleries. Development work on the galleries began in 2008 and was completed in 2011. The centre has been relocated to the former site of Balestier Hill Primary School. The new MOE Heritage Centre@Balestier was officially opened by Minister for Education Mr Chan Chun Sing on 30 August, 2022.
