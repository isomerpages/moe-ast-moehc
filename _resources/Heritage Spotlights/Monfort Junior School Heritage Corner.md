<p>Montfort Junior school began as a single class of students in rural Serangoon
in 1916. It became Holy Innocents’ English School, Montfort School’s predecessor
and started the first English class. In 1959, Holy Innocents’ English School
was renamed Montfort School in honour of its founder, St Louis Marie De
Montfort, whose efforts to educate the young, were carried on by the Brothers
of St Gabriel.</p>
<p>Montfort School split into Montfort Junior School and Montfort Secondary
School in 1974.</p>

<p>The corner is conceptualised to remind Montfortian of the legacy of the
Montfortian spirit, instilling a sense of belonging and pride. It serves
as a reminder for each Montfortian to strive to be "A Montfortian, A Man
for Others," and live out the school’s CHRISTE values. Mr. Lim Ah Pin is
prominently highlighted as an alumnus who exemplifies values like Compassion
and Service through his contributions to the Hougang community.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature in the corner, besides photo artifacts depicting
Mr. Lim Ah Pin’s service to the community, is the “before and after” photo
artifact comparisons of prominent community landmarks, such as the Simon
Road market. This allows students to appreciate the changing landscape
in the Hougang community, where the Montfort schools began their story
and still tug the heartstrings of many Montfortian, past and present.</p>
