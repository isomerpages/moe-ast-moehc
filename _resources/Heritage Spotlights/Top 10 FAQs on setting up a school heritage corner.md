If you are planning or refreshing your school heritage corner, check out these FAQs extracted from a guide on Developing Heritage Corners by the National Heritage Board.

Read the full guideÂ [here](/files/Heritage%20Corner%20May%202017.pdf)Â for a comprehensive outline on how to get started!

##### **1\. What would be the purpose of the school heritage corner?**

Begin with theÂ **WHY**. Clear objectives and functions are essential for setting the direction and development of the heritage corner. Consider these suggestions:

**Document and Disseminate History**Â as a repository of heritage and memories<br>
**Complement Curriculum and Learning Outcomes**Â e.g. school's Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) and humanities subjects<br>
**Create a Focal Point**Â for School and Community<br>
**Platform to Cultivate a Sense of Identity and Belonging**Â through heritage activities<br>
**Nurture Heritage Enthusiasts**Â among students and the community

##### **2\. How do I plan for the heritage corner project? What kind of project team do I need?**

Identify the various manpower resources available for the project.

Consider the following:<br>
**Project Committee or Panel - to** oversee the development and progress of the heritage corner. This may comprise Board members or experienced curators, historians and project managers<br>
**Project Team**Â -Â the people at the core! Generally, the team would comprise a project manager and three to five members to take on delegated tasks.

**_Researchers, Runners and Guides-_**Â students and alumni can play an active role in developing content. You can also tap on Parent Support Groups, community clubs and residentsâ€™ committees.<br>
**V_endors_**Â _â€“ your school may wish to consider engaging vendors as external support._

##### **3\. How do I develop content for my school heritage corner?**
Content is the heart of the heritage corner. Develop a research plan that covers the following:

**\-Â  Plan a timeline**Â for the research work  
**\-Â  List Types of records/information**Â to be collated including school and MOE records, publications, newspapers and interviews etc.  
\-Â Â **List sources**Â to tap on such as the school library, alumni and staff, the NationalÂ  Â  Archives of Singapore, Singapore Press Holdings Information Resource Centre, museums and the National Library etc.  
**\-Â  Plan Interviews**Â to be conducted (especially where primary materials are insufficient)  
**\-Â  Collate Images, Artefacts and Other Materials**.  
Allocate resources to track and acquire relevant images and artefacts for display. Consider collecting the following:

School uniforms, badges, student cards, awards and trophies, records such as publications, record books, registers and attendance books.

Note: Document and record the acquisition, loan and return of images and artefacts, plus identify a dedicated space to house all materials in a safe and clean environment with proper handling.

##### **4.Â How do I start planning the heritage space?**

Make time for spatial planning â€“ How you plan to use it. These are some primary considerations:<br>
**Storytelling**\- plan the layout so visitors can follow the story with ease.<br>
**Flow of Traffic**\- consider how many visitors your school wishes to comfortably hold the space at any one time.<br>
**Entrance and Exit**Â â€“ these should be clearly marked and easily accessible, in case of emergencies.<br>
**_Activity Space_**_\- you may_Â wish to incorporate an activity space for student activities e.g. performances or short discussions.

##### **5\. What kind of budget do I need to set aside for my school heritage corner?**
The budget is a critical factor in determining the scale and complexity of the heritage corner.<br>
For starters,consider these 3 key areas:

\-Â **Content development:**Â developing the concept and story, research and copywriting, copyright fees etc<br>
\-Â **Design cost:**Â layout and planning, showcase design etc<br>
\-Â **Construction and fabrication:**Â fabrication of furniture, artefacts and props, lightingÂ  Â  and electrical works etc.

##### **7\. How do I select the location of the school heritage corner?**
In a school compound, possibilities abound! Here are some things to consider:

**Size -**Â What is the available surface area for display and how many people can be there at one one time?<br>
**Accessibility -**Â Is it located in a place with high traffic or a more isolated area?<br>
**Construction -**Â Are there any safety or infrastructural features to be considered? E.g. sprinklers, fire exits, pipes, electric cables etc. Would construction work affect school routines? Is the shape and layout of the space simple or irregular?<br>
**Lighting and Ventilation -**Â Is the area well-lit, well-ventilated or air-conditioned? Â   
Will mould growth be an issue?<br>
**Maintenance -**Â Is the area indoors or outdoors? Would weather elements such as sunshine, wind or rain affect the space and exhibits?<br>
**Safety -**Â Would the exhibits hinder any evacuation routes during emergencies?

Many types of spaces can be used creatively for an impactful design! Heritage spaces need not be confined to rooms only. Consider common areas, corridors, even ceilings, pillars, stairways and the spaces under them.

#####  **8\. What do I need to bear in mind when selecting images for the heritage corner?**
There are a number of sources that can be used as graphic elements in a heritage corner â€“ photographs, images of records and artefacts, newspaper cuttings, stock images. Do consider the following:

**Copyright Issues**Â â€“ source and permissions, usage fees, how to credit for use etc.<br>
**Content relevance**Â â€“ are the images suitable and convey the right message?<br>
**Technical issues**Â â€“ e.g.Â _suitable size and format of the image_

##### **9\. What are some safety considerations to bear in mind in designing the space for the heritage corner?**

Safety is a key factor in design. Some things to note:

**Design of Structures and furniture â€“**Â watch out for rough or sharp edges.<br>
Dimensions of furniture should consider age group of the students and their height and size.  
**Ceiling Decorations â€“**Â ceiling fixtures should be safely away from fan blades and studentsâ€™ reach.<br>
**Flooring -**Â The flooring of the heritage corner should be even to prevent tripping and falling.<br>
**Exits -**Â Exits must be prominently labelled for ease of emergency evacuation if needed<br>
**Fire Safety -**Â The heritage corner must comply with fire safety regulations

##### **10\. What do I need to plan for when the heritage corner is completed?**
Now that the job is done, look into these aspects as well:

**Handover**Â â€“ a handover exercise between school and vendor may include user training for equipment and software, and handover of research materials<br>
**Maintenance arrangements**Â -ensuring the proper care and long life of the elements in the space<br>
**Resource Management**Â â€“ proper cataloguing and archiving of content resources e.g. records, research materials etc.<br>
**Content Updates**Â â€“ plans to refresh and updated on a regular basis, and rotation of artefacts if necessary<br>
**Activities**Â - explore opportunities to create and conduct heritage themed activities and exercises
