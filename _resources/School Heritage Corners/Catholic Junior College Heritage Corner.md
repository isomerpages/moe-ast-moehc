<p>In 1970, the Ministry of Education presented a proposal to the Catholic
Education Council, suggesting the consolidation of pre-university (Sixth
Form) classes from affiliated Catholic schools into a single Junior College. 
The Catholic Mission, led by Archbishop Michel Olcomendy, MEP, approved
the plan, placing the new Junior College under the Archdiocese's administration,
making it the first institution not affiliated with a specific Catholic
Order but directly under the Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The foundation stone was laid by Dr Lee Chiaw Meng, then Minister for
Education, on 12 July 1974, on a site at Whitley Road. The school was officially
opened on 26 June 1976 by Mr E.W. Barker, then Minister for Law and Environment,
with Brother Patrick Loh appointed as the first principal.&nbsp;</p>
