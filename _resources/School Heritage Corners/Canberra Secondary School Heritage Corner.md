<p>The Canberra Secondary School Heritage Gallery, located in the former
Parent Support Group (PSG) Room and about half the size of a typical classroom,
is designed around the theme “My Nation, My Home, My Future”. It showcases
the school’s milestones, the heritage of Sembawang, and Singapore’s national
story through timelines, displays, and artefacts. The gallery connects
students with their roots, nurtures pride in their identity, and deepens
their appreciation of values such as gratitude, respect, and compassion.
It serves as a learning space where history and heritage come alive, inspiring
Canberrans to honour the past and shape the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
