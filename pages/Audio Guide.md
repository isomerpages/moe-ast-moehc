</p><p>Step into this zone and travel back in time to 1819, when Sir Stamford Raffles first set up a British settlement in Singapore.  
  
As the population grew, British colonial administrators, philanthropists and missionaries started building more schools. Examine the scale models in the glass display to see what Singapore’s earliest schools looked like.  
  
By the turn of the 20th century, education in Singapore had seen significant progress. Sit at the old school desk and imagine what it was like to be a student then!  
  
Take a look at the boxes on the wall. Open them to examine how the Japanese Occupation affected school life.  
  
Behind you, the bamboo scaffoldings represent the efforts to restore education and build social cohesion in post-war Singapore. The artefacts on display illustrate the introduction of a common curriculum, marking a turning point in Singapore’s education.

</p><p>Move into 1959, the year that Singapore attained self-government.  
  
As a young nation lacking natural resources, Singapore had to rely on education to build a skilled labour force.  
  
Head towards the TV and surrounding displays. Learn how the education system nurtured a rugged society to meet the demands of a newly independent nation.  
  
You may have noticed the mobile library at the centre of the zone. It was introduced in the 1960s as a nationwide initiative to promote reading by bringing library services to the people.  
  
Do you recognise the ‘made-in-Singapore’ textbooks here? They were developed by the Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore, which was established to produce high quality educational materials.

Look out for the touchscreen to learn about the values and beliefs that have guided teachers through the generations.  
  
Examine the illuminated glass pillars. Each holds artefacts that signify the progress of teacher development through the years.
