#### **School History**
Millennia Institute was established in 2004 with the merger of Outram Institute and Jurong Institute. It became the only centralised institute in Singapore offering a three-year General Certificate of Education (GCE) A-Level course and the commerce stream, in addition to the arts and science streams. 

Founded in 1987, the former Outram Institute was the first centralised institute to offer the three-year GCE A-Level course, followed by Jurong Institute in 1989. The two institutes were merged in order to synergise their resources and expertise to enhance the delivery of a holistic education for students.

Between 2004 and 2006, Millennia Institute operated from two separate campuses at Toh Tuck (former Jurong Institute campus) and Bartley (former Outram Institute campus). Millennia Institute relocated to its new single, purpose-built campus at Bukit Batok West Avenue 8 in December 2006. 

Millennia Institute’s mission is to nurture students’ talents to achieve diverse definitions of success beyond the academic. Its signature MI.World Programme equips students with a global perspective and cross-cultural skills. Students are also trained in design thinking to drive the spirit of innovation_._ Started in 2005, MI Mart provided opportunities for the real-world application of innovation and entrepreneurship skills, and it eventually evolved into MI Social Bazaar in 2017.  Additionally, self-directed learning programmes – such as the student-led Values in Action, Gap Week, Job Experience and MI SkillsFuture Programme – instil in students a sense of autonomy, mastery and purpose in learning for life. These school-wide leadership development opportunities and other co-curricular programmes collectively nurture self, team and community leaders of character and values to serve the nation and beyond. The institute’s Amethyst Talent Programme further supports the holistic development of students by developing those with academic aptitude and talent in sports and the arts.  

In 2015, the school’s vision was refined to ‘A Forward-looking Community of Learners, Thinkers and Leaders’ to reflect the school’s focus on preparing students for a world that is volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous. 

Millennia Institute marked its 15th anniversary in 2018 with a celebration of its unique position as a place of opportunity and an alternative pathway to the university.

\- Mr Tan Chor Pang (2006–2013)<br>

#### **School Crest**
<img src="/images/mi1.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The logo is made up of four arcs, which resemble the vertical lines of the letters 'm' and ‘I’, the initials of the school name. The blue arc acts as the firm foundation for the other three arcs to pivot or propel themselves forward. It also signifies the strong values of integrity, resilience, respect and responsibility that are cultivated within each individual in Millennia Institute.

The largest red arc sheltering the smallest red arc on the right captures the close relationship between teachers and students, in which teachers act as mentors, supporters and motivators. The red arc on the left signifies the management and support staff playing an auxiliary, albeit significant, role in the institute.

As a holistic entity, the logo is a three-dimensional sculpture – each arc is distinctive and unique in design, but together, in synergy, they form a dynamic force that is confident and optimistic.
