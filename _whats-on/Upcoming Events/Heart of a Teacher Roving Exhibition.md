<p>What empowers a teacher to guide students in the discovery of their strengths
and identity? What inspires the fraternity of teachers and spurs them on?</p>
<p>Journey with eight teachers in Singapore from the 1950s till today â€“ meet
a profile for each decade you traverse. Through their eyes, experience
how teaching looks and feels like during their time, and the timeless values
and beliefs that anchor them. Experience it yourself through this new roving
exhibition. Visitors get to interact with the tactile displays that are
incorporated into the exhibits.</p>
