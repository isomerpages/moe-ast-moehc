<h2><strong>Growing Together: A Journey through School Campaigns</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<h4>Journey with your child into the past, present and future of school campaigns at our interactive workshop!   &nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Inspired by the MOE Heritage Centre's SG60 roving exhibition, <em>Seeds of Change: School Campaigns from the 1950s till the Present</em>,
this 45-minute programme invites families to share stories across generations,
explore the values and beliefs that have shaped our nation, and reflect
together on what Singapore means to them today. Through interactive activities
and heartfelt conversations, parents and children will not only learn about
past school campaigns but also create new memories rooted in pride, connection,
and commitment to our shared future. Grow closer as a family while planting
seeds of inspiration for the next generation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
