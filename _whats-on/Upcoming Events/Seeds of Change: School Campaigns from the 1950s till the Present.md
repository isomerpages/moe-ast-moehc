<p>Presented by MOE Heritage Centre, Academy of Singapore Teachers and The
Ministry of Education, the roving exhibition revisits school campaigns
from the nationâ€™s first days of self-government in the 1950s till today.</p>
<p>Take a walk down memory lane to rediscover the many varied campaigns that
sought to improve the health and wellness of school children, create a
cleaner and greener environment for them and shape their habits and values.
From brushing our teeth by the tuckshop drain to cleaning our classrooms
with rags and pails to show we care, these are some of the familiar scenes
from school campaigns in Singapore, past and present.</p>
