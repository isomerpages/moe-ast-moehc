### **Our School Building Heritage**
Discover our school heritage and how school designs have transformed over the years.

#### **Early School Spaces**

<b>In the early 1800s until the 1940s before World War II broke out, schools were mainly set up by various communities whose main purpose was to provide education for their children.</b>

These were purpose-built buildings erected for educational use. Many of these schools were built in the European architectural style.<br><br>

Places of worship like temples, churches and mosques bonded people within their communities. Many of these were converted to become schools offering a vernacular education.<br><br>

Many early schools started in shophouses that functioned as living quarters for immigrants, or offices for clan associations. These shophouses were built with a covered five-foot-way at the shopfront and were either two or three storeys.<br><br>

Schools were often set up in kampongs so that people living in villages would have access to education. A village school was typically built with an attap roof and wooden walls.<br><br>

#### **Standardising School Designs**

<img src="/images/schbuildingheritage1.png" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
<b>During post-war Singapore, it became the top priority of the day to ensure that every child had a place in school. The 1960s saw schools being built rapidly and the addition of new facilities to meet the needs of the developing nation.</b>

<input type="checkbox" id="accordion5">  
  
<label for="accordion5">Multi-Storey Schools</label>  
  
<div>  
  
<p>
Under the 1947 Ten-Year Programme, five standard school designs were created. This included multi-storey school buildings which were proposed to maximise land space. By building upwards, schools were able to increase student enrolment and accommodate more facilities.<br><br>

<p>
As the nation shifted its focus towards technical and science education, technical schools were built and facilities were expanded to accommodate the curriculum. Science laboratories, metal and carpentry workshops and home economic rooms became standard features in schools.

Integrated schools were created to foster bonding among students from two or more language streams. The typical design for primary schools was a four-storey H-shaped building. For secondary schools, the design incorporated facilities for academic, science and technical education.

#### **Breaking the Mould**

<img src="/images/schbuildingheritage2.png" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
<b>With a growing population in the 1970s and 1980s, more schools were built in new housing estates. These schools sported new designs and were equipped with modern facilities. Over the years, many schools developed their own architectural identity.</b>

In 1969, the first junior college, National Junior College, was established. Every junior college was given a six-hectare plot of land and equipped with lecture theatres, audio-visual rooms, language and computer laboratories, multi-purpose halls as well as a host of sports facilities.

New school designs sprang up in emerging housing estates. 12 different plans were introduced and each had a unique design identity. A common school design was a large sloping tiled roof and a steel space frame over a concourse.<br><br>

In 1999, MOE launched Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME) in line with the vision of ‘Thinking Schools, Learning Nation’. Schools constructed before 1997 would be upgraded or rebuilt in phases, to ensure a conducive environment for teaching and learning.<br><br>

Complementing PRIME, Flexible School Infrastructure (FlexSI) framework was introduced in 2005 to give primary and secondary schools more control over their spaces. This provided school infrastructure with greater flexibility in teaching and learning.<br><br>
