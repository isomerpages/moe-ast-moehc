Life in Singapore remained difficult even after the war. People faced severe shortages of food and other supplies. Even though schools had reopened, there were not enough teachers and places for returning students. In response, the colonial government ordered the restoration of schools. The 1947 Ten-Year Programme was introduced to provide equal opportunities for all children as well as a centralised education system where schools would adopt the same curriculum, textbooks and common language of instruction.

A key step in rebuilding education was the formulation of the Ten-Year Programme. Drawn up for the years 1947 to 1957, the Ten-Year Programme aimed to provide equal opportunities for education and make primary education free for all children. Under the plan, it also set out to meet the demand for trained teachers which led to the establishment of the Teachers Training College in 1950.<br><br>

The government continued to push through its efforts for a centralised education system through the 1956 White Paper on Education Policy. The White Paper suggested the increased use of Malayan-centred textbooks and a multilingual programme in schools, so as to achieve social cohesion between students from different language streams.

The post-war period saw shortages of food, medicine and other basic supplies. Many schools had also been damaged or destroyed, which led to limited places in school and a lack of proper facilities. Teaching materials were inadequate and there were not enough teachers.<br><br>

Many returning students were overaged and had their education disrupted due to the war. To alleviate the problem of limited spaces in schools, double-session schooling (morning and afternoon) was introduced to take in more students. Night schools were also set up for students to continue their lessons after hours.<br><br>

In 1950, the Teachers’ Training College was established to address the acute shortage of teachers after the war. Housed in the old premises of Anglo-Chinese School at Cairnhill Road, its role was to centralise teacher training and meet the demand for locally trained teachers. The curriculum comprised studies in education theories and psychology, language, civics as well as art, music and physical education.<br><br>
