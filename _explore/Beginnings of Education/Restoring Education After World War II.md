Life in Singapore remained difficult even after the war. People faced severe shortages of food and other supplies. Even though schools had reopened, there were not enough teachers and places for returning students. In response, the colonial government ordered the restoration of schools. The 1947 Ten-Year Programme was introduced to provide equal opportunities for all children as well as a centralised education system where schools would adopt the same curriculum, textbooks and common language of instruction.
