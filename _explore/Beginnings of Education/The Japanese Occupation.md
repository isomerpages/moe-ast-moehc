Education came to a near-complete standstill, during the years of the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945. The war interrupted schooling for most, as schools were destroyed or seized for military use. The Japanese Military Administration required all students to speak Japanese, and to take instruction in the Japanese language. They had hoped that people would acquire the Japanese spirit and an undying loyalty to the Emperor.
