Education came to a near-complete standstill, during the years of the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945. The war interrupted schooling for most, as schools were destroyed or seized for military use. The Japanese Military Administration required all students to speak Japanese, and to take instruction in the Japanese language. They had hoped that people would acquire the Japanese spirit and an undying loyalty to the Emperor.

Prior to the Japanese invasion of Singapore, there were already concerns of impending war. In preparation for the growing military threat, schools and students prepared themselves for the war to come.<br><br>

In schools, students were taught how to recognise bombs and how to administer first aid. Schools were later used as air raid shelters and hospitals.

To enforce the learning of the Japanese language, dedicated language schools like Syonan Nippon Gakuen were set up in 1942, taking in students of different ages and occupations. Students had to undergo a three-month course of study during which they learned the Japanese language and were taught the Japanese spirit and way of life.<br><br>

The teaching of Japanese in schools was also made compulsory in 1942. Teachers had to undergo Japanese language instruction and were banned from using the English language in schools. Teachers who struggled to learn the language or who were unwilling to learn were dismissed.	<br>

Every morning, students and teachers had to assemble, face the direction of the Imperial Palace, and bow deeply. The Japanese flag would be raised as they sang Kimigayo, the Japanese national anthem.<br><br>

As the war went on, Singapore experienced food shortages. Many schools had to grow their own food, and gardening became part of the curriculum. Students were encouraged to grow an assortment of local vegetables. Tapioca, which grew well without special care, became a staple food for the people.<br><br>
